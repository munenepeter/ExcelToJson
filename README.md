# ExcelToJson
A simple application that takes an Excel doc and converts it to a json file;

It uses php to write the file, since one cannot write to a disk with js;

It's a improvement from [excel-to-json-by-javascript](https://github.com/jayanthbabu123/excel-to-json-by-javascript);

## Installation

For you to create the json file [download](https://github.com/munenepeter/ExcelToJson/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or [clone](https://github.com/munenepeter/ExcelToJson.git) and run it with a php server

 ## Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Fork or download, and i need some help in implementing dynamic variables names in js
