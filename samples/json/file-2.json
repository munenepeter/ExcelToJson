However, it added the caveat that the SRM and SSM regulations and the German SSM Authorising Act (SSM-VO-Gesetz) had to be interpreted strictly. In their remarks, the German judges emphasised that the SSM Regulation does not fully confer on the European Central Bank (ECB) banking supervision in the euro area. They pointed out that the ECB only performs certain tasks that relate to all credit institutions in the euro area.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126\/2008 was amended by Regulation (EU) 2017\/1986 to bring that Regulation in line with the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 16 Leases that the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published on 13 January 2016.

Given the far-reaching change and exceptionality introduced into the macrofinancial setting by the crisis, this Financial Stability Report (FSR) is in a special format. Specifically, it focuses on analysing the transmission channels of this shock (in particular, to the domestic financial sector), its potential and actual impact up to the cut-off date for this report, and the factors that may help mitigate its effect, including most notably the response of economic policies. The coronavirus pandemic and the necessary containment measures applied are exerting a most severe impact on economic activity. As a result, the risks to global financial stability have increased substantially. The economic policy measures adopted \u2013 at the national, European and international levels \u2013 should help mitigate these risks. In the short term, the pandemic and the containment measures adopted by the authorities to control it directly impact economic activity and financial developments (see Figure 1) via the reduction in the supply and demand for goods and services. The containment measures drastically limit people\u2019s movements and entail the virtual full suspension of activity in certain productive processes. Initially, the country most affected by these measures was China, which has now been joined by a growing number of economies, Spain among them. The leading indicators of activity show that the impact on Chinese output has been most significant, although the latest data point to a degree of recovery (see Chart 1). In Spain and in the other advanced economies, activity is also seen, with something of a lag, to be contracting most severely. This sharp adjustment is likewise feeding through to the emerging economies, including those of most importance in terms of exposure of Spanish financial institutions. These countries are highly dependent on global demand and on the course of commodities prices, which have collapsed.

Since mid-March, the Forum has virtually convened senior leaders from financial institutions, international organizations, central banks and other institutions for several discussions about the impact ofCOVID-19 on the financial system. These discussions aimed to identify emerging financial stability risks, understand adjustments to consumption andinvestment due to COVID-19, discuss where policy-maker attention is required, and share emergency measures implemented by firms as well as lessons learned from thiscrisis and earlier times of market stress. This briefing summarizes the key findings of these discussions, providing insight into financial market trends, private-sector views of government responses to date and priorities for future policy, areas of risk and uncertainty, and expectations for the future. While some context on market activity and policy decisions is provided, the focus is on sharing the views expressed by the participants in these Forum-hosted discussions, rather than a comprehensive overview of the situation.The goal is to present the current state of debate among keyfinancial system stakeholders.

The economic situation and the ECB\u2019s policy actions have evolved substantially since that point. The ECB will do everything necessary within its mandate to help the euro area through this crisis.  2019 marked the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the euro, and support for the single currency among euro area citizens reached an all-time high of 76% in the November Eurobarometer poll. Euro area economic growth moderated further in 2019, to 1.2% from 1.9% in the previous year. The continued expansion was supported by favourable financing conditions, further employment gains and the mildly expansionary fiscal stance, although global trade-related uncertainty weighed most notably on manufacturing and investment.Euro area labour markets continued to improve in 2019. The unemployment rate declined further to 7.6%, and wage growth remained robust, around its long-run average. Headline inflation in the euro area stood at 1.2% on average in 2019, down from 1.8% in 2018. This decline reflected lower contributions from the two more volatile components, energy and food. Excluding these two components, inflation averaged 1.0% in 2019, the same as in the two previous years. Against that background, the ECB\u2019s Governing Council undertook further monetary accommodation in 2019 over three successive rounds. This included a new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, an extension of our forward guidance, areduction in our deposit facility rate and the resumption of our asset purchase programme. By the end of 2019 there were some initial signs of a stabilisation of growth dynamics and a mild increase in underlying inflation. As part of our policy assessment process, the Governing Council takes into consideration the impact of any potential side effects of our policy. In that vein, a two-tier system for reserve remuneration was introduced, which exempts a fraction of banks\u2019 excess cash reserves from the negative deposit facility rate, in order to safeguard the bank-based transmission of monetary policy. Structurally low profitability remains a challenge for euro area banks, although the sector is adequately capitalised, with a 14.2% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. During 2019 strong risk-taking in financial and real estate markets continued to fuel the build-up of asset price vulnerabilities, while risks continued to increase in the growing non-bank financial sector. Euro area countries, in consultation with the ECB, implemented a number of macroprudential measures to mitigate and build up resilience to systemic risks.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"06.05.2020","Page count":217,"Issuing body":"European Central Bank (ECB)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Single Supervisory Mechanism - SSM","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"Capital Requirements Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"CSDR - Central Securities Depositories Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"EMIR - European Market Infrastructure Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"EU Benchmark Regulation","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"LI; IFRS","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.bde.es\/bde\/en\/secciones\/informes\/Publicaciones_de\/Informe_Anual_de\/index2019.html","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent 22.05.2020","Upload owner":"DDD","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Rebecca","Day tracked":"22.05.2020","Reg pub.

The Remittance Rule imposes requirements on entities that send international money transfers, or remittance transfers, on behalf of consumers. Among its requirements, the Rule mandates that remittance transfer providers generally must disclose the exact exchange rate, the amount of certain fees, and the amount expected to be delivered to the recipient. The Rule also allows for depository institutions to estimate certain fees and exchange rate information under certain circumstances, but by statute, this provision expires in July 2020. The final rule allows certain banks and credit unions to continue to provide estimates of the exchange rate and certain fees under certain conditions. This could preserve consumers\u2019 ability to send remittances from their bank accounts to certain countries or recipient institutions. The final rule also increases the threshold that determines whether an entity makes remittance transfers in the normal course of its business and is subject to the Rule. Entities making 500 or fewer transfers annually in the current and prior calendar years would not be subject to the Rule. This will reduce the burden on over 400 banks and almost 250 credit unions that send a relatively small number of remittances\u2014less than .06 percent of all remittances. Last month, the Bureau also announced regulatory flexibility as a result of the impact the pandemic is having on consumers\u2019 finances, both here and around the world. Because many consumers rely on remittance transfer providers to send money from the United States to their families and friends abroad, the Bureau took action to minimize the impact of the pandemic on the remittances market by enabling insured institutions to continue to focus on the immediate needs of their customers. The final rule will further provide regulatory certainty that will continue to enable consumers to send money to their family and friends overseas during the pandemic and beyond.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"11.05.2020","Page count":153,"Issuing body":"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)","Country":"United States","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"RFA - Regulatory Flexibility Act","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"COVID-19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Final Rule","Analyst comments":"New Li possibly?: Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA)","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/about-us\/newsroom\/?title=&categories=press-release&topics=regulation-e&topics=regulation-m&topics=regulation-p&from_date=&to_date=","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent 22.05.2020","Upload owner":"DDD","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"22.05.2020","Reg pub.

The current situation is unprecedented and requires the implementation of exceptional measures, adapted to the circumstances. In the agriculture and food sectors, numerous difficulties are reported, resulting from the heavy movement restrictions in place in the Member States, as well as compulsory closings of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other similar establishments. Economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities creates cash and cash flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses who process agricultural products. Some small businesses and farmers are therefore in dire need of emergency assistance to maintain their operations. Given the difficulties that administrations face at the same time, which make it impractical for advisers to be physically present to help potential beneficiaries or for controllers to carry out in situ or ex ante checks, it is essential to offer simple and practical solutions that can be deployed by the Member States and respond to various situations on the ground while being easily accessible to beneficiaries. The support will have to take the form of temporary aid, with a very targeted purpose in unprecedented circumstances. To achieve the objectives set, this support will consist of the allocation of a single lump sum to farmers and SMEs engaged in the processing, marketing and \/ or development of agricultural products. Commission payments will be made on the basis of budgetary appropriations and subject to financial availability. In order to ensure the most efficient use of the resources available under existing rural development programs, Member States will be required to demonstrate that the aid is intended for the most affected, according to objective and non-discriminatory criteria. Member States should incorporate the measure into the RDPs by amending them, it being understood that expenditure will be eligible from the start of the catastrophic event (COVID-19 outbreak).","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"30.04.2020","Page count":22,"Issuing body":"European Commission (EC)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Regulation","Document Type (2)":"Proposal","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.chd.lu\/wps\/portal\/public\/Accueil\/TravailALaChambre\/Recherche\/RoleDesAffaires\/!ut\/p\/z1\/lZFNbsJADIXPwgEqO56QhOWQFHcIoSVRBjIbNKUBjRR-hFIq9fQlqIu2i7T1ztb3nvxsMLACc7AXt7OtOx5sc-0rE6wJJ1pPiGVeEqHkoS5yFQhMPVjeAPxWEsc5jQUiPxKY_-u_Ov1N3wOYfvslmBuSUKJz5RNG8YhQ8WKWxt4QuRA_AQ4XPtL0fhqWxVzwKPgE-m7w2xbVNUW4fvKy6CGOMGNWCUqRpiHzTCD5UHQebn9q3Ma12fGlbqBqz691N7ab7llQbV3T1mft6jc47ctyhU7d2ed3KQeDD4A2HII!\/p0\/IZ7_P1M8HC80MGGID0A3KK7GGL3024=CZ6_20FVVF2GARU220AG5VSRI630K1=LA0=Epage!1=javax.portlet.action!changePageFilter==\/#Z7_P1M8HC80MGGID0A3KK7GGL3024","Predicted document severity":"Green","QA Comments":"Sent 27.05.2020","Upload owner":"DDD","Content URL":"NOT IN THE SHARED SHEET","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"26.05.2020","Reg pub.

These requirements are intended to ensure that there are sufficient shares available for trading to facilitate proper price discovery in the secondary market. In recent years, U.S. investors have increasingly sought exposure to emerging markets companies as part of a diversified portfolio. As a result of this interest, emerging market companies have sought to raise funds in the U.S. and list on Nasdaq. While many of these listings have similar trading attributes and rates of compliance concerns compared to U.S. companies with similar profiles, the lack of transparency from certain emerging markets raises concerns about the accuracy of disclosures, accountability, and access to information, particularly when a company is based in a jurisdiction that has secrecy laws, blocking statutes, national security laws or other laws or regulations restricting access to information by regulators of U.S.-listed companies in such jurisdiction (a \u201cRestrictive Market\u201d). These concerns can be compounded when the company lists on Nasdaq through an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) or business combination with a small offering size or a low public float percentage because such companies may not attract market attention and develop sufficient public float, investor base, and trading interest to provide the depth and liquidity necessary to promote fair and orderly trading. As a result, the securities may trade infrequently, in a more volatile manner and with a wider bid-ask spread, all of which may result in trading at a price that may not reflect their true market value.

To what extent these risks will further materialise will critically depend on two drivers: the economic impact of the pandemic, and any occurrence of additional external events in an already fragile global environment.

The proposed rule would provide requirements for determining fair value in good faith with respect to a fund for purposes of section 2(a)(41) of the Act. This determination would involve assessing and managing material risks associated with fair value determinations; selecting, applying, and testing fair value methodologies; overseeing and evaluating any pricing services used; adopting and implementing policies and procedures; and maintaining certain records. The proposed rule would permit a fund's board of directors to assign the fair value determination to an investment adviser of the fund, who would then carry out these functions for some or all of the fund's investments. This assignment would be subject to board oversight and certain reporting, recordkeeping, and other requirements designed to facilitate the board's ability effectively to oversee the adviser's fair value determinations. The proposed rule would include a specific provision related to the determination of the fair value of investments held by unit investment trusts, which do not have boards of directors. The proposed rule would also define when market quotations are readily available under section 2(a)(41) of the Act. If rule 2a-5 is adopted, the Commission would rescind previously issued guidance on the role of the board of directors in determining fair value and the accounting and auditing of fund investments.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"13.05.2020","Public response date":"21.07.2020","Page count":37,"Issuing body":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)","Country":"United States","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Investment Company Act (United States)","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"CFR Title 17 - Commodity and Securities Exchanges","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"Investment Advisers Act (United States)","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"Securities Act 1933 (United States)","Document Type (1)":"Proposed Rule","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.federalregister.gov\/documents\/search?conditions%5Bagencies%5D%5B%5D=securities-and-exchange-commission&conditions%5Btype%5D%5B%5D=RULE&conditions%5Btype%5D%5B%5D=PRORULE&order=newest","Predicted document severity":"Green","QA Comments":"Sent 27.05.2020","Upload owner":"DDD","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"27.05.2020","Reg pub.

Modelling considered by National Cabinet showed that if far reaching action was not taken, up to 22.7 million Australians (89.1 per cent of the population) could have become infected with the virus, with up to 1.4 million (5.4 per cent of the population) requiring hospitalisation. Given Tasmania\u2019s population, this would have resulted in an estimated 477 000 Tasmanians infected with COVID-19 and 29 400 being hospitalised. An unmitigated COVID-19 pandemic would have dramatically exceeded the capacity of the Australian health system over a prolonged period of time. Given the older and more vulnerable Tasmanian population, the importance of action being taken by the State Government was particularly vital. Reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality has been dependent upon the introduction of a combination of measures to strengthen and extend public health clinical capacity and the overall reduction of infection transmission in the community. In addition to the health impacts, the necessary actions taken to slow the spread of the disease are resulting in significant economic and social consequences across Tasmania. The strength of the Tasmanian economy and the State\u2019s Budget position, prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, has been an important factor in shaping and supporting the Government\u2019s response to the pandemic. Social and Economic Support Measures announced by the State Government represent direct expenditure, the removal of the efficiency dividend requirements for agencies, funding set aside for loans, reductions in State revenues, and grants provided directly to those who are needing them the most during this uncertain time. Total support to the community will be in excess of $1 billion. This includes, additional expenditures in excess of $327 million, reductions in revenue in excess of $194 million, loans in excess of $200 million, the removal of efficiency dividends on agencies of $268 million and waiver of quarterly bills for small business by Aurora (est $27 million) and TasWater (est $25 million). Some of these measures provide support beyond the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years detailed in this report. The most recent economic, financial and budgetary information published by the Government was the Revised Estimates Report 2019-20 (including the December Quarterly Report) published on 11 February 2020. The economic and budgetary estimates presented in that Report were prepared at an early stage in the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and there was a high level of uncertainty in relation to the economic and fiscal impacts. As a result, the impact of COVID-19 was identified as a budget risk and preliminary commentary was provided on the economic risks. Since that time, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant global, national and local impact. In response, the Government has announced a range of revenue and expenditure measures to support the health of Tasmanians and the broader community, and support the Tasmanian economy. Some initial measures were endorsed by State Parliament through the passage of a Supplementary Appropriation Act in relation to 2019-20 and a Supply Act in relation to 2020-21. In recognition of the uncertainty surrounding the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Tasmania\u2019s economic and fiscal position, the priority of addressing the immediate impacts of the pandemic and the constraints imposed on public sector resources, a decision was made by the Government to delay the 2020-21 Budget until later in 2020 (the previously announced date was 4 June 2020). This decision was consistent with similar announcements made by the Australian Government and other States and Territories. At the time of the announcement of the delay in the timing of the 2020-21 Budget, the Treasurer advised that updated information on the Government\u2019s economic and fiscal position would be provided prior to the 2020-21 Budget. In accordance with this commitment, on 30 April 2020, the Treasurer announced that he had requested the Secretary of the Department of Treasury and Finance to prepare and publish an Economic and Fiscal Update. He also stated that this update would include revised General Government Sector financial statements for the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years, updated economic estimates, commentary on the economic and fiscal position and the legislatively required 2019-20 March Quarterly Report. This Economic and Fiscal Update Report has been prepared by Treasury in accordance with the Treasurer\u2019s commitment. Further financial information is required to be published under the provisions of the Financial Management Act 2016 during 2020. This includes the Preliminary Outcomes Report (by 15 August 2020) which will provide estimates of the financial outcome for 2019-20, the Treasurer\u2019s Annual Financial Report (by 31 October 2020) which will provide the Government\u2019s audited financial statements for the 2019-20 year and the September Quarterly Report. It is envisaged that additional information on the impact of COVID-19 will be included in the POR and TAFR. As is usual practice, the 2020-21 Budget will provide comprehensive agency and whole-of-government budget information in relation to the 2020-21 Budget year and Forward Estimates period (2021-22 to 2023-24) together with other information generally included in the Budget Papers. The 2020-21 Budget will be delivered in November 2020.

In addition, these assurances proved to be ineffective in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. With this proposed law, the attention of the consumer will have to be drawn, better than today, to the fact that these insurance products are only optional. These insurance contracts will have to be brought into line, better than today, with the needs of the client.

Government consumption also maintained solid growth. One new phenomenon, however, was a steady slowdown in external demand, on which the export- and manufacturingoriented Czech economy is heavily dependent. During the year, weakening foreign leading indicators passed gradually through initially into domestic leading indicators and later also into domestic real variables, especially industrial production. The external uncertainties related to the trade disputes between the USA and China, the persistent uncertainty regarding Brexit, and the unclear outlook for the  European automotive industry facing the challenge of a forced transition to electromobility.

Also there is a positive trend among financial institutions to better account for climate related risks of their assets. This can be concluded from the publications the NGFS released today: A Guide for Supervisors gathering leading practices of the supervisory community and issuing five recommendations for courses of action to be taken by NGFS members and beyond. A Status Report on financial institutions \u2019 experiences from working with green, non green and brown financial assets and a potential risk differential offering an overview of industry definitions and practices regarding environmental related risks\u2019 quantification and mitigation. The Guide for Supervisors \u2013the first of its kind\u2013 sets out five recommendations for courses of action of members of the NGFS as well as the broader community of banking and insurance supervisors to integrate climate-related and environmental risks into their work. The content of the guide is based oninput received from NGFS members and work done by supervisors outside the network.The outcomes clearly show that worldwide supervisors are taking action: They are building their expertise and allocating resources, undertaking climate-related and environmental risk analyses of their financial institutions and are publishing documents to clarifying to financial institutions what is expected of them regarding climate-related and environmental risks. The practices showcased in the guide aim to further inspire supervisors and help them accelerate their efforts. Frank Elderson, Chair of the NGFS and executive board member of De Nederlandsche Bank: \u201cEven under the current challenging circumstances of the pandemic crisis, we should not lose sight of the fact that climate change and environmental issues remain as urgent and vital as ever. Action is urgently needed, also from a financial risk perspective. With these two publications, the 66 central banks and supervisors and the 12 observers involved in the NGFS show that they are fully determined to continue their work to address climate-related and environmental risks.\u201d The NGFS Status Report on Financial institutions\u2019 experiences from working with green, non-green and brown financial assets and a potential risk differential gives an overview of the current state of play of industry practices. This report highlights the main findings of a survey conducted by the NGFS among 49 banks and five insurance companies around the globe. This survey aimed at understanding how financial institutions kept track of the specific risk profiles of green, non-green and brown financial assets (loans and bonds), developed specific risk metrics and analysed potential risk differentials. Although not conclusive on the existence of a risk differential, the report shows positive trends among financial institutions to better account for climate related risks of their assets and suggests encouraging ways forward in the analysis via forward-looking methodologies. The report recalls the impossibility for a complete assessment without harmonized green and brown taxonomies.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"27.05.2020","Page count":64,"Issuing body":"Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)","Country":"International","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Capital Requirements Regulation II (CRR II)","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"Solvency II Directive","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Guidance","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.dnb.nl\/en\/news\/news-and-archive\/persberichten-2020\/dnb388936.jsp","Predicted document severity":"Red","Upload status":"With IT","Upload owner":"DDD","Content URL":"AJax Error on Upload","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"03.06.2020","Reg pub.

However, the current pandemic crisis has changed this economic reality in a sudden and dramatic manner. This crisis represents a major negative shock to global public health, with equally very adverse economic consequences for many countries, which are still difficult to fully assess. This Bulletin includes a Special issue describing the channels through which the pandemic crisis affects economic activity and the policy responses taken by the authorities to sustain the financial situation of firms and the health and income of households. In 2019 the Portuguese economy expanded further, despite decelerating for the second year in a row. This deceleration took place against a background of generalised slowdown in global activity, associated with high levels of uncertainty. Heightened trade tensions, only eased at the end of the year with the prospect of a partial trade agreement between the United States and China, and weakening industrial production, in particular in the automobile sector, explain an even more pronounced deceleration in international trade flows. As a result, a decoupling in developments in industry and services was observed in the main advanced economies, with activity decelerating significantly more in industry, even falling in a number of countries (Box 3 \u201cThe industry-services decoupling: Portugal in the context of advanced economies\u201d in this Bulletin). Over the year, further monetary accommodation by the main central banks and the adoption of expansionary fiscal policies in several countries likely contributed to dampen the economic slowdown. The euro area was no exception. Exports decelerated and domestic demand continued to be the driver of economic growth, supported by continued favourable financial conditions and labour market improvements. Over the course of the year, the ECB strengthened the monetary policy accommodative stance in the euro area, against a background of low actual inflation and deteriorating inflation expectations, as well as less buoyant economic activity and persistent downside risks. Growth in GDP and GDP per capita in Portugal continued to be higher than in the euro area. Indeed, the growth differential has been positive in actual terms since 2016 and in per capita terms since 2013. Nevertheless, and even before the onset of the current pandemic crisis, continuing the convergence process of the Portuguese economy remained a complex challenge that became more pressing in the face of the difficulties arising from an increase in potential output growth, in particular an ageing population. In contrast to developments in the past few years, a notable feature of the Portuguese economy in 2019 was a substantial increase in labour productivity. These developments were largely due to the productivity increase within each sector \u2013 in particular, services \u2013 while the contribution related to employment flows between sectors remained slightly positive, continuing to suggest this input is gradually moving towards more productive sectors of the economy. An economy\u2019s productivity and competitiveness are also the result of the contribution of the remaining inputs, including the capital stock per worker, the quality of human capital, and the quality of business management (Box 4 \u201cA characterisation of top managers in Portugal\u201d in this Bulletin), as well as of technology. In the Portuguese economy, where productivity levels are lower than the euro area average, it is paramount to push for innovation (Box 5 \u201cInnovation indicators in Portugal\u201d in this Bulletin) and to monitor the process of becoming more digital (Box 6 \u201cHow digital is the Portuguese economy?\u201d in this Bulletin).","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"28.05.2020","Page count":125,"Issuing body":"Bank of Portugal (Banco de Portugal)","Country":"Portugal","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Bulletin","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.bportugal.pt\/en\/publications\/banco-de-portugal","Predicted document severity":"Red","Upload owner":"DDD","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Matt","Day tracked":"04.06.2020","Reg pub.

The UK Money Laundering Regulations, applying to financial institutions, date from 1993, the current Regulations being those of 2017 (as amended). The offence of money laundering was contained in various acts of parliament (such as the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986). The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA) consolidated, updated and reformed the law relating to money laundering to include any dealing in criminal property. Specific obligations to combat terrorist financing were set out in the Terrorism Act 2000. Many of the procedures which will be appropriate to address these obligations are similar, and firms can often employ the same systems and controls to meet them. Purpose of the guidance The purpose of this guidance is to: \u2022 outline the legal and regulatory framework for anti-money laundering\/countering terrorist financing (AML\/CTF) requirements and systems across the financial services sector; \u2022 interpret the requirements of the relevant law and regulations, and how they may be implemented in practice; \u2022 indicate good industry practice in AML\/CTF procedures through a proportionate, risk-based approach; and \u2022 assist firms to design and implement the systems and controls necessary to mitigate the risks of the firm being used in connection with money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

It covers the range of services from the provision of a basic bank account facility to complex money transmission business for a medium sized commercial business. In this guidance, retail banking does not cover credit cards, which are dealt with in sector 2. For many firms, retail banking is a mass consumer business and will generally not involve close relationship management by a named relationship manager. This sectoral guidance refers primarily to business undertaken within the UK. Firms operating in markets outside the UK will need to take account of local market practice, while at the same time ensuring that equivalent CDD and record-keeping measures to those set out in the ML Regulations are applied by their branches and subsidiary undertakings operating in these markets. There is a high risk that the proceeds of crime will pass through retail banking accounts at all stages of the money laundering process. However, many millions of retail banking transactions are conducted each week and the likelihood of a particular transaction involving the proceeds of crime is very low. A firm\u2019s risk-based approach will therefore be designed to ensure that it places an emphasis within its strategy on deterring, detecting and disclosing in the areas of greatest perceived vulnerability. There is an increasing risk of fraudulent applications by identity thieves. However, such applications represent a very small percentage of overall applications for retail banking services. The provision of services to cash-generating businesses is a particular area of risk associated with retail banking. Some businesses are legitimately cash based, including large parts of the retail sector, and so there will often be a high level of cash deposits associated with some accounts. The risk is in failing to identify such businesses where the level of cash activity is higher than the underlying business would justify, thus providing grounds for looking more closely at whether the account may be being used for money laundering or terrorist financing.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"01.06.2020","Page count":251,"Issuing body":"Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG)","Country":"United Kingdom","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Proceeds of Crime Act 2002","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"Terrorism Act 2000","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"Criminal Finances Act 2017","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"AMLD IV - Anti-Money Laundering Directive IV","Document Type (1)":"Guidance","Analyst comments":"LI; E-money Reg, FSMA, WTR, PSD2, EMD","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/jmlsg.org.uk\/news\/","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 11.06.2020","Date sent to DDD":"Sent to DDD on 11.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog","File name":"JMLSG-Guidance_Part-II_June-2020-1","Additional information":"Due to the size and the contents of the document we are waiting for a better time to upload","Status":"With JWG"},{"Analyst Name":"Rebecca","Day tracked":"08.06.2020","Reg pub.

To that end, it comprises a range of provisions intended to correct any information asymmetries which could affect the commercial relationship between lenders and borrowers by specifying the transparency obligations incumbent on both parties. Thus, firms applying for credit have to supply sufficiently exhaustive data on their financial statements, among other things. For their part, lenders must make available to applicants standard documents corresponding to the various forms of credit which they offer 1 . In addition, a proposed credit agreement has to be accompanied by a brief information document setting out all the characteristics of the contract. The lender must also ascertain the most suitable type of credit, taking account of the firm\u2019s financial position at the time of conclusion of the contract and the purpose of the credit. These provisions aim in particular to stimulate competition between credit institutions by making it easier for firms to compare the various options available to them. In the event of a refusal to grant credit, the lender must inform the firm of the essential reasons for that refusal or the factors influencing the risk assessment, and that information must be transparent and comprehensible for the firm. The law also includes an article on the rules for fixing the prepayment penalty which the lender is entitled to demand from any borrowers who decide to repay their loan early. The loan agreement must explicitly mention the amount of the penalty. The latter is determined by a standardised procedure according to a method of calculation defined in a code of conduct, revised in 2018 following changes to the law and agreed between employers\u2019 organisations representing the interests of self-employed workers (the SNI) and SMEs (Unizo and the UCM), on the one hand, and Febelfin on the other. For loans for an initial sum of no more than \u20ac 2 million, the penalty must not exceed six months\u2019 interest. At the time, the financial sector had expressed certain reservations on this last provision, raising concerns of a relative increase in the interest rate on loans to SMEs.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"28.05.2020","Page count":17,"Issuing body":"National Bank of Belgium","Country":"Belgium","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.nbb.be\/en\/publications-and-research\/economicfinancial-publications\/last-publications","Predicted document severity":"Amber","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 13.06.2020","Date sent to DDD":"Sent to DDD on 13.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"04.06.2020","Reg pub.

In light of this, a sound infrastructure system underpinning the market has become increasingly important in serving the needs of industrial customers and the real economy. The base metals markets in the West have all gone through the gradual evolution from their embryonic forms to where they are as mature markets today. This market in the United States, for example, also faced the problem of insufficient regulation to maintain market order and insufficient standardisation at its early stage of development. Their experience accentuated the importance of sound major infrastructure and trade-support mechanisms in supporting the base metals trading system and thereby driving the growth of the base metals market. Further, the standardisation, modernisation and informatisation of such infrastructure and trade-support mechanisms could enhance the operational efficiency and economic benefits of market participants, while remarkably improving the internal management efficiency of industrial enterprises and reducing costs. Among all the infrastructures underpinning the spot commodities market, a well-developed warehouse logistics system is considered the most important. Safety of the warehouse system is a cornerstone of spot trading in commodities in that it gives participants the assurance to conduct various types of related business. Thus, a warehouse network which can provide reliable global reference prices and \u201cmarkets of last resort\u201d for base metals market participants is an indispensable and fundamental part of the physical metals market. Spot trading of base metals often requires huge financing support in the entire production and logistics process because of the time lag in capital recycling. Given such a large demand for financing support, base metals manufacturers and traders often get operationally constrained during economic downturn when such financing support is insufficient. This kind of financing support efficiency is also lowered in case of irrational warehouse receipt financing practices whereby the credibility of the warehouse receipts cannot be guaranteed. Since base metals by nature are of high value, easy to transport and store, readily liquid and subject to a clearly defined quality grading system, they are actually very good financing tools. Therefore, warehouse receipt financing has become a crucial integral part of the spot market in base metals. The outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008 reflected to a certain extent the serious lack of flexibility of market participants in withstanding financial and economic turmoil as well as the deficiency in market transparency. Against this backdrop, global financial markets at all levels have begun shifting to adopt central clearing and settlement in place of a bilateral system in certain sectors. The commodity financial derivatives market for base metals is hardly an exception. The soundness and effectiveness of the infrastructure and trade-support mechanisms of a commodities market is best judged by whether they are conducive to effective and efficient resource allocation, thereby helping the market and the industry to lower transaction costs. This is also one of the most fundamental purposes for which any trading platforms (including futures exchanges) exist, and their position and interests shall all be in accordance with such purpose. As for market participants, they will naturally go for whichever pricing centre that is more regularised, more transparent, with abundant participants, more internationalised and more capable of manifesting the price formation and guidance mechanism fairly and effectively. These considerations are particularly important for Mainland China\u2019s base metals market which is in the process of development and internationalisation. Market development and improvement do take time, and ultimately the market itself will decide what best meets the needs of the industry. All these are worth our continuous attention.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"29.05.2020","Page count":17,"Issuing body":"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited","Country":"Hong Kong","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Other","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.hkex.com.hk\/?sc_lang=en","Predicted document severity":"Amber","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 13.06.2020","Date sent to DDD":"Sent to DDD on 13.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"05.06.2020","Reg pub.

The guidelines\u2019 purpose is to provide guidance on the outsourcing requirements applicable to financial market participants when they outsource to cloud service providers. In particular, they aim to help firms and competent authorities identify, address and monitor the risks and challenges that arise from cloud outsourcing arrangements. Steven Maijoor, Chair, said: \u201cCloud outsourcing can bring benefits to firms and their customers, for example reduced costs and enhanced operational efficiency and flexibility. It also raises important challenges and risks that need to be properly addressed, particularly in relation to data protection and information security. \u201cFinancial markets participants should be careful that they do not become overly reliant on their cloud services providers.. They need to closely monitor the performance and the security measures of their cloud service provider and make sure that they are able to exit the cloud outsourcing arrangement as and when necessary.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s proposals will help firms understand and mitigate the risks that they are exposed to when outsourcing to cloud service providers.\u201d The proposed guidelines set out: \u2022 The governance, documentation, oversight and monitoring mechanisms that firms should have in place; \u2022 The assessment and due diligence which should be undertaken prior to outsourcing; 3 June 2020 ESMA71-99-1334 ESMA \u2022 201-203 rue de Bercy \u2022 CS 80910 \u2022 75589 Paris Cedex 12 \u2022 France \u2022 Tel. +33 (0) 1 58 36 43 21 \u2022 www.esma.europa.eu \u2022 The minimum elements that outsourcing and sub-outsourcing agreements should include; \u2022 The exit strategies and the access and audit rights that should to be catered for; \u2022 The notification to competent authorities; and \u2022 The supervision by competent authorities. The proposed guidelines are consistent with the recommendations on outsourcing to cloud service providers published by the European Banking Authority (EBA) in February 2017 and subsequently incorporated into revised EBA guidelines on outsourcing arrangements in February 2019, and the guidelines on cloud outsourcing published by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in February 2020. Next steps The consultation is open until 1 September and seeks feedback from both national competent authorities and financial market participants that use cloud services provided by third parties. The consultation is also important for cloud service providers, as the draft guidelines aim to ensure that potential risks firms may face from the use of cloud services are properly addressed.

The recommendations in this report build on our platform of sound, evidence-based policy positions, to determine what will make the most impact as we move towards economic recovery, such as reducing company tax for all businesses, promoting the modernisation of obsolete systems and products, simplifying payroll tax and abolishing stamp duty on life insurance. The FSC has developed a plan to democratise investment in critical domestic infrastructure development, making these projects not only attractive but also accessible to every Australian with money in superannuation. The new Australian Superannuation and Infrastructure Investment Vehicles (ASIIVs) will unlock a large chunk of funds - around $1.7 trillion in choice and Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) - for infrastructure projects from investors who today have limited access to them. The FSC and its members are here to do our bit to drive Australia\u2019s long-term economic recovery.

In addition, we are amending certain rules and forms to tailor the disclosure and regulatory framework to these investment companies. These amendments also will modernize our approach to securities registration fee payment by requiring closed-end investment companies that operate as \u201cinterval funds\u201d to pay securities registration fees using the same method as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds and extend the ability to use this payment method to issuers of certain continuously offered, exchange-traded products (\u201cETPs\u201d).

The companies, which are based in Cleveland, Tennessee, offer payday and auto-title loans and own and operate about 156 stores in eight different states: Alabama, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. The Bureau found that Approved Cash provided deceptive finance charge disclosures in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA) and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), violated the CFPA and TILA by failing to refund overpayments on its loans, and violated the CFPA by engaging in unfair debt collection practices. The consent order prohibits Approved Cash from engaging in this unlawful conduct in the future and requires it to pay consumer redress and a civil money penalty. Specifically, the Bureau found that Approved Cash violated the CFPA\u2019s prohibition against engaging in deceptive acts or practices and TILA by concealing and understating the actual finance charges of its auto-title loans, which are called auto-title pledge transactions under Mississippi state law, for over 4,000 consumers. Consumers paid a total of over $3.5 million more than the finance charge listed in Approved Cash\u2019s loan disclosures. The Bureau also found that Approved Cash violated the CFPA\u2019s prohibition against unfair acts or practices and TILA by retaining consumers\u2019 overpayments on their loans for months and sometimes years instead of returning those funds to consumers. The Bureau also found that Approved Cash engaged in unfair debt collection practices in violation of the CFPA when it made numerous calls to consumers\u2019 workplaces, references, and other third parties after being asked to stop, and improperly disclosed consumers\u2019 debts to third parties or used tactics that risked such disclosure. The consent order imposes a judgment against Approved Cash of approximately $3.5 million in consumer redress, which amount is suspended upon its payment of $2 million of that judgment and $1 civil money penalty to the Bureau based on Approved Cash\u2019s demonstrated inability to pay. Whenever the Bureau collects a civil money penalty through an enforcement action, that penalty is deposited into the Bureau\u2019s Civil Penalty Fund. Assuming continued available funds, the Bureau will work to provide full relief to eligible harmed consumers from this fund. The consent order also prohibits Approved Cash from misrepresenting finance charges in its auto-title pledge transactions, requires it to ensure that consumers with credit balances over $1 are refunded timely, and prohibits it from engaging in the same unlawful debt collections practices.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"02.06.2020","Page count":28,"Issuing body":"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)","Country":"United States","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"CFR Title 12 - Banks and Banking","Document Type (1)":"Order","Analyst comments":"Within ten days of the Effective Date, Respondents shall pay to the Bureau, in the form of a wire transfer to the Bureau, and in accordance with wiring instructions provided by counsel for the Bureau, $2 million, as required by this section, for the purpose of providing redress to the Affected Title Consumers.' https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/policy-compliance\/enforcement\/actions\/main-street-et-al\/ or https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/about-us\/newsroom\/cfpb-settles-short-term-lenders-engaging-unfair-deceptive-acts-practices\/","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/policy-compliance\/enforcement\/actions\/","Predicted document severity":"Amber","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 14.06.2020","Date sent to DDD":"Sent to DDD on 14.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"09.06.2020","Reg pub.

ESMA\u2019s technical advice details how to specify the conditions under which the commercial terms for the provision of clearing services are to be considered FRANDT. The final report containing ESMA\u2019s technical advice takes into account the feedback received, aiming to strike a balance between improving clearing client\u2019s access to clearing services and ensuring such services are provided on FRANDT compliant terms, while ensuring the requirements are proportionate and within the mandate received. The requirements covered in this technical advice have been carefully designed to address clearing clients and clearing service providers\u2019 concerns and aims to: \u00b7 facilitate comparability of the information disclosed; \u00b7 address the process of onboarding clearing clients; \u00b7 standardise the information disclosed to clients bilaterally; and \u00b7 encourage further standardisation of contractual terms. As part of a broader effort to facilitate access to clearing, the EMIR review (Refit), has introduced the requirement for clearing members and clients who provide clearing services to do so under FRANDT terms by June 2021. The EC is mandated to develop a delegated act to define the requirements for such FRANDT terms and tasked ESMA in June 2019 with producing technical advice on the FRANDT terms as input for the development of the delegated act.

Date":"04.06.2020","Client\u00a0":"ING","Source URL":"https:\/\/www.arbeitgeber-banken.ch\/files\/content\/pdf\/Brochure_Digitalisation_in_Banking.pdf","Document Name":"Impacts of digitization on the Employment Market in banking","Document Summary":"Together with employer banks, Rundstedt's outplacement provider commissioned a study that takes a close look at the real and concrete effects of digitalization on the job market in the banking world. The study is intended to examine how and to what extent digitization specifically affects the advertised job profiles and the skills required.  Brassel & Partner Consulting carried out the study by (1) collecting and analyzing existing knowledge, (2) evaluating all vacancies in the banking sector in Q4 2019 as part of a quantitative analysis and (3) the results in personal interviews with leading HR personalities from the banking environment have been validated and deepened. The following are the main findings from the study: IT profiles are the most popular workforce in the banking industry. \u201cWith 20% of vacancies, IT profiles are in second place after relationship managers (24%). But if you add all the outsourced jobs in the IT area, the IT profiles in the banking industry are clearly the top priority \u00bb. In the vacancies of banks and bank-like organizations, the relationship managers resp. Leading customer advisor profiles. Just behind are 20% of the advertised positions, but already the IT profiles, where significant  employment growth takes place due to the structure. However, it must be taken into account that a large part of the IT resources have been continuously outsourced by banks for years and increasingly taken over by  external providers. It can therefore be clearly stated that IT profiles are the most sought after workforce in the banking industry. The third place is due to the system, the positions in the areas of law, compliance and  risk management. For positions outside of IT, IT user knowledge is often not mentioned at all and hardly any digital business skills are required. \"Although successful digital transformation requires digital or IT skills outside of the immediate IT positions, they are hardly mentioned in job advertisements\". It is obvious that a successful digital transformation cannot only be accomplished by specialist departments and IT specialists. Such a fundamental organizational development must be supported and supported by  the entire organization. That is why digital business skills and general IT skills are not only crucial for IT positions, but also for many other roles and business functions outside of IT. There is a significant polarization in these positions: On the one hand, 64% of these job advertisements do not mention IT user skills and 22% speak of basic skills. On the other hand, 14% of the vacancies include  advanced or even professional IT user skills. Competencies and experience in digital business are even listed as a request or requirement in only 9% of the vacancies. Banks talk a lot about the great need for digital  skills. However, not much of it can be seen in the job advertisements on the labor market. Transversal competencies as success factors in the digital age \"Today, the transversal basic competencies are more important than quickly disappearing specialist competences\". To master the new world of complexity, dynamics of change and agility, organizations need people with basic transversal skills. With these skills, an organization can ensure that the right expertise is always in the  right place at the right time. These competencies include analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, creativity, customer-centered thinking, adaptability, flexibility, learning agility or social and emotional skills. In the  future, recruitment processes will focus more on these skills, although this is more of a medium-term trend. It is interesting that these transversal skills are already systematically defined and mentioned in the job  advertisements. Lack of urgency in digital transformation \u00abHR managers see themselves as playing a key role in digital transformation. There is a strong awareness of the changed job and competence requirements. But there is hardly any urgency \u00bb. HR managers see themselves in a central role when it comes to digital transformation. Responsibility relates to two crucial aspects. (1) The implementation of the transformation must be accompanied by effect ive and efficient change management activities. (2) The guideline must be supported as best as possible in the cultural change towards an agile organization with a digital mindset and with transverse skills. The HR  managers show a strong awareness that there are major shifts in job and competence requirements. However, there is little sense of urgency. This is also shown by the quantitative analysis of the job market, where  the new requirements are hardly reflected. 5. COVID-19 helps with the digital transformation \"The current crisis is significantly accelerating the ongoing structural change in digital transformation\". The Corona crisis is giving the current structural change in digital transformation an additional boost. Due to the external conditions and the regulatory shock, many companies were forced overnight to switch to  virtual forms of collaboration and service provision. In addition, this period of crisis is boosting those companies that have invested in digital products or services. This positive dynamic will soon be seen on the job  market at best. It could not yet be taken into account in this study.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"04.06.2020","Page count":21,"Issuing body":"Arbeitgeberverband Banken (AGV Banken)","Country":"Switzerland","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.arbeitgeber-banken.ch\/aktuell","Predicted document severity":"Amber","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 14.06.2020","Content URL":"AJax Error on Upload","Date sent to DDD":"Sent to DDD on 14.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Lucy","Day tracked":"12.06.2020","Reg pub.

Within just a few weeks, the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus has sent the world economy into a deep recession. In particular, the far-reaching measures to contain the spread of the virus have weighed heavily on economic activity in many places. In China, where the pandemic originated, economic life largely came to a standstill in the first half of February 2020. Similar developments are becoming evident elsewhere, with a certain time lag. In the euro area, real gross domestic product (GDP) was already down substantially in the first quarter. In March, three major Member States \u2013 Italy, Spain and France \u2013 felt impelled to take drastic measures due to rapidly rising case numbers. Beyond the services sector, some industrial firms whose output was considered non-essential were also closed in those countries. In the United Kingdom and the United States, too, aggregate output fell considerably in the first quarter. However, the main impact of the containment measures is unlikely to be reflected in the GDP figures until the second quarter almost everywhere \u2013 with the exception of China, where the economy is already recovering after material restrictions were lifted. The same will hold for most emerging market economies. Some are suffering from the additional burden of worsened financing terms and the steep drop in commodity prices.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"18.05.2020","Page count":178,"Issuing body":"Deutsche Bundesbank","Country":"Germany ","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.bundesbank.de\/en\/publications\/reports\/monthly-reports\/monthly-report-may-2020-832786","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"22.06.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 16.06.2020","Content URL":"AJax Error on Upload","Date sent to DDD":"Sent to DDD on 16.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"16.06.2020","Reg pub.

Creating effective policy on cross-border data flows is a priority for any nation that critically depends on its interactions with the rest of the world through the free flow of capital, goods, knowledge and people. Now more than ever, cross-border data flows are key predicates for countries and regions that wish to compete in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and thrive in the post COVID-19 era. Despite this reality, we are witnessing a proliferation of policies around the world that restrict the movement of data across borders, which is posing a serious threat to the global digital economy, and to the ability of nations to maximize the economic and social benefits of data-reliant technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain. We hope that countries wishing to engage in cross-border data sharing can feel confident in using the Roadmap as a guide for designing robust respective domestic policies that retain a fine balance between the benefits and risks of data flows.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"09.06.2020","Page count":50,"Issuing body":"World Economic Forum","Country":"International","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)","Document Type (1)":"Whitepaper","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.weforum.org\/whitepapers\/a-roadmap-for-crossborder-data-flows-future-proofing-readiness-and-cooperation-in-the-new-data-economy","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"23.06.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 17.06.2020","Content URL":"AJax Error on Upload","Date sent to DDD":"Sent to DDD on 17.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"17.06.2020","Reg pub.

Cloud allows industries to tap into new service models, utilising its technological advancement for new and better services to customers, improving productivity, cost-efficiency and flexibility of internal business processes. Ultimately, cloud computing can provide a foundation for the digital transformation of the industry in question. The financial sector is in the process of adopting cloud computing to take advantage of the aforementioned benefits. New opportunities for service delivery to customers, serving their needs and expectations, are as relevant as improving security, reducing costs and improving flexibility in the conduct of business. Cloud can also open new markets and enable mature financial services institutions to find new ways of competing with FinTech market entrants. The cloud security framework matured fast and heavily. Nowadays, cloud computing seems to be as well-placed as (if not better than) other traditional IT paradigms when it comes to safeguarding integrity and availability. Cloud services embody redundancy, high availability and resiliency thanks to their distributed nature. Public cloud gives the ability to scale at a more significant level than financial institutions would be able to achieve on their own. Resilience, speed and security are the building blocks of cloud offerings and the core business of any Cloud Service Provider (CSPs). In most cases, CSPs have stronger security than most individual companies can maintain and manage on-site. Moreover, the big cloud providers have large teams of security engineers and, given that cloud is (one of) their core businesses, they are continuously investing in meeting the strictest and newest security standards that constantly adapt to managing evolving threat vectors and threat actors.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"04.06.2020","Page count":41,"Issuing body":"EBF - European Banking Federation","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Other","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.ebf.eu\/?s=guidance","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 19.06.2020","Date sent to DDD":"Sent to DDD on 19.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"18.06.2020","Reg pub.

It is now used every day by around 342 million people in 19 Member States in the euro area. The practical benefits of the euro include stable prices, lower transaction costs for citizens and businesses, more transparent and competitive markets and increased intra-EU and international trade. The euro is also the second most used currency worldwide. Article 140(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereafter TFEU) requires the Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) to report to the Council, at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation1 , on the progress made by such Member States in fulfilling their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union. The latest Commission and ECB Convergence Reports were adopted in May 2018. The 2020 Convergence Report covers the following seven Member States with a derogation: Bulgaria, Czechia, Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden2 . A more detailed assessment of the state of convergence in those Member States is provided in the Staff Working Document accompanying this Report3 . Article 140(1) TFEU requires the reports to include an examination of the compatibility of national legislation, including the statutes of the national central bank, with Articles 130 and 131 TFEU and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereafter ESCB\/ECB Statute). The reports must also examine whether a high degree of sustainable convergence has been achieved in the Member State concerned by reference to the fulfilment of the convergence criteria (price stability, public finances, exchange rate stability, longterm interest rates), and by taking account of other factors mentioned in the final subparagraph of Article 140(1) TFEU. The four convergence criteria are developed further in a Protocol annexed to the Treaties (Protocol No 13 on the convergence criteria). The 2008-2009 financial and economic crisis, along with the euro-area sovereign debt crisis, had revealed certain gaps in the economic governance system of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and showed that its instruments needed to be strengthened and used more comprehensively. With the aim of ensuring a sustainable functioning of EMU, an overall strengthening of economic governance in the Union was undertaken. The assessment of convergence is thus aligned with the broader European Semester approach which takes an integrated look at the economic and employment policy challenges facing the EMU in ensuring fiscal sustainability, competitiveness, financial market stability, economic growth and high employment. The key governance reforms, reinforcing the assessment of each Member State's convergence process and its sustainability, included inter alia the strengthening of the excessive deficit procedure by the 2011 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and new instruments in the area of surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances. In particular, this report takes into account the findings under the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure.

The banks have estimated that they will have paid approximately \u00a3300 million in redress. The redress programme is nearly complete. Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA said: 'Banks are required to treat customers fairly, even when those customers are in financial difficulties or are having trouble meeting their obligations. By not sufficiently understanding their customers\u2019 circumstances the banks risked treating unfairly more than a quarter of a million customers in mortgage arrears, over several years. In some cases, customers were treated unfairly, including vulnerable customers. 'Customers should still pay what is owed, but banks are obliged to treat their customers fairly when making new payment arrangements. 'Firms should take notice of the action we have taken today to ensure that their own treatment of customers meets our expectations.' Between April 2011 and December 2015 the banks\u2019 systems and procedures for gathering information from mortgage customers in payment difficulties or arrears resulted in the banks\u2019 call handlers not consistently obtaining adequate information to assess customers\u2019 circumstances and affordability, creating a risk that customers were treated unfairly. The banks also employed a system that set a minimum percentage of a customer\u2019s contractual monthly payment which a call handler was authorised to accept as a payment arrangement without obtaining further authority from a more senior colleague. However, in practice, the system created a risk of inflexibility in approach, with the result that call handlers may have failed to negotiate appropriate payment arrangements for customers. These risks were exacerbated when, as part of a simplification programme, the banks lost a large number of personnel with mortgage collections and recoveries expertise, after which point nearly all of their mortgage arrears call handlers were new-to-role. The FCA therefore found that the banks breached Principle 3 and Principle 6 of the FCA\u2019s Principles for Businesses between 7 April 2011 and 21 December 2015. Some of the failings were identified by the banks as early as 2011 but the steps the banks took failed fully to rectify the issues. Failings were then identified as part of a thematic review conducted by the FCA in 2013. During 2014 and 2015 the banks took a number of further steps to address the concerns raised by the FCA and on several occasions informed the FCA they were on track to implement those improvements. However, a further review by the FCA in July 2015 found that the banks had failed to make sufficient progress in addressing the problems and the banks were required to undertake a Skilled Person\u2019s review. The banks did not dispute the FCA\u2019s findings and exercised their right, under the FCA\u2019s partly contested case process, to ask the FCA\u2019s Regulatory Decisions Committee to assess the appropriate level of sanction. The banks\u2019 agreement to accept the FCA\u2019s findings meant they qualified for a 30% discount. Otherwise, the FCA would have imposed a financial penalty of \u00a391,495,400. In July 2017, the banks implemented a group-wide customer redress scheme which included refunding all broken payment arrangement fees, arrears management fees and interest accrued on the fees and the refund of litigation fees if applied unfairly or, in some circumstances, automatically. The banks have estimated that approximately 526,000 customers will have received redress payments totalling \u00a3300 million.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b By November 2019 the banks had already made payments of approximately \u00a3259.9 million to customers. The banks have proactively contacted all the customers they believe are due for compensation however, any customer who has not been contacted and think they may have been affected should contact their bank. The fair and appropriate treatment of customers experiencing financial difficulty remains a focus for the FCA and the FCA is working to ensure that firms raise their standards in this area. Firms should ensure there is appropriate investment in their staff who work in collections and recoveries, including in training and effective management information, to allow firms to monitor customer outcomes and take appropriate action where needed. The FCA recognises the challenges firms face in this area posed by coronavirus (Covid-19), which only heightens the importance of firms treating customers in financial difficulty fairly and appropriately.

In times of economic downturn or stress such as the current crisis caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19), adequate lending standards and risk-based pricing become even more important as losses materialise. The report, which is based on data on new lending by banks from 2016 to 2018, contains a number of industry-wide findings, including: banks with high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) tended to grant housing loans more conservatively than other banks; not all banks paid sufficient attention to risk-based pricing, particularly to ensure that loan pricing at least covered expected losses and costs; no evidence was found that banks using internal models to calculate capital requirements applied better risk-based pricing; on average, banks lowered their lending standards for loans to households over the period: they took more risks, while working with tighter margins resulting from narrower pricing spreads (interest rate charged minus funding costs); new loans granted to non-financial corporations showed a mixed picture in terms of banks\u2019 risktaking combined with mostly decreasing pricing spreads. The analysis also produced bank-specific findings, which supervisors have discussed with the banks in question and have asked them to follow up. In focusing on loan origination practices, ECB Banking Supervision aims to strengthen banks\u2019 resilience, which is one of its supervisory priorities. The ECB considers proper credit underwriting essential to the stability of banks. The report contains the industry-wide findings of a project launched in May 2019 to collect data from 95 significant banks in the euro area on new loans granted during the period 2016-18 for different lending portfolios.

Their implementation in the EU must be faithful, proportionate and mindful of the specificities of the EU banking market. The EBA\u2019s tasks include assessing ex ante the impact of policy proposals on EU institutions and providing advice on the specification of prudential policy in the EU banking sector. In this context, on 4 May 2018, the EBA received from the European Commission a call for advice on the implementation of the Basel III post-crisis reforms, the main aim of which is to reduce excessive variability of risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and improve the comparability of banks\u2019 capital ratios across jurisdictions. The Basel III post-crisis reforms were finalised by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2017. In addition, further advice was requested from the EBA on the implementation of the revised framework for market risk \u2013 i.e. the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) \u2013 in the EU. As a response to the call received from the Commission, the EBA prepared an advice on the implementation of Basel III in the EU. The EBA\u2019s advice was structured in two parts, consistently with the different timelines for producing the advice specified in the call, to take into account international developments that were ongoing in the area of market risk. The first part of the EBA\u2019s advice was published on 5 August 2019 and included a specific policy assessment of the revised Basel framework in the area of credit risk, securities financing transactions (SFTs), operational risk and the output floor. The second part was published on 4 December 2019 and included a policy assessment of the revised frameworks for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk and market risk, and a macroeconomic impact assessment of the Basel III reforms.

As the risks associated with the continued provision of new LIBOR-linked products increase, \u2018LIBOR transition: Case studies for navigating conduct risks\u2019 highlights issues for market participants to address when offering new products to clients or changing performance benchmarks. While the LIBOR transition presents market participants with unique challenges, many of the conduct-related risks, and the means of managing them, are not novel. The paper therefore builds on existing FMSB principles and relevant regulatory expectations, combining the broad expertise of FMSB\u2019s IBOR Transition Working Group participants, and explores ways in which firms can manage the uncertainties and associated risks of the transition through the lens of non-prescriptive good practice observations. The paper includes four practical case studies which cover cash and derivative products and performance benchmarks. The case studies are relevant across the sell-side, buy-side and corporates. This paper has been developed by FMSB\u2019s IBOR Transition Working Group which has representation from a wide range of FMSB member firms. FMSB intends to add to this Spotlight Review during the transition process to include additional case studies focusing on areas of uncertainty that are of particular concern to market participants.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"11.06.2020","Page count":26,"Issuing body":"FICC Markets Standards Board (FMSB)","Country":"International","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"IBOR Transition","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/fmsb.com\/fmsb-publishes-a-spotlight-review-on-navigating-conduct-risks-in-libor-transition\/","Predicted document severity":"Amber","SLA due":"30.06.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 24.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Matt","Day tracked":"24.06.2020","Reg pub.

The report consists in 17 recommendations put forward with the intent of addressing relevant issues related to corporate access to finance, pan-European market architecture, retail investment and cross-border investment. Recommendation on CSDR: The European Commission is invited to conduct a targeted review of Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) to strengthen the CSD passport and facilitate the servicing of domestic issuance in non-national currencies. This should be accompanied by measures to strengthen the supervisory convergence among National Competent Authorities (NCAs). These measures, taken jointly, should enhance the cross-border provision of settlement services in the EU. Justification: A targeted review could usefully tackle the following issues: 1. CSD passporting and links: While the objective of CSDR is to create a \u201ccommon CSD market\u201d free of regulatory barriers and to offer CSDs a European passport, divergent application by NCAs of the rules according to which (I)CSDs should meet CSD links framework requirements and provide services in another Member State creates procedural and regulatory hurdles, fragmenting the post-trade landscape along national lines. 2. Cross-border payments and access to Central Bank and commercial liquidity: The CSDR has unintendedly limited access to global liquidity pools for CSDs without a \u201climited purpose banking license\u201d. Consequently, these CSDs cannot service domestic issuance in other currencies, including sovereign debt. The CSDR foresees the possibility for CSDs without a banking licence to appoint a \u201cdesignated credit institution\u201d. However, such liquidity providers have not emerged yet. National Central Banks (NCBs) should facilitate non-domestic (I)CSDs to process settlement in Central Bank Money in other currencies (including those frequently used for issuance and settlement: GBP, CHF, USD), after taking due account of the implications of such access. Alternatively, the CSDR restrictions that prohibit CSDs holding a banking license to provide such services to other CSDs could be amended. 3. Supervision of CSDs: Divergence in national supervisory approaches is still an important fragmentation factor in the provision of settlement services that generates costs and limits the cross-border offer. Given that securities laws are not harmonised across EU 27, NCAs still have a role to play. Therefore, ESMA\u2019s work within the current scope of its mandate in terms of convergence should be continued and strengthened. The aim should be to ensure convergence in supervisory approaches across the Member States to reduce administrative burdens on CSDs and to generate the value added for the EU financial markets in terms of the CSDR objectives.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"10.06.2020","Page count":129,"Issuing body":"European Commission (EC)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"MiFID II - Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"MiFIR - Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"EMIR - European Market Infrastructure Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"UCITS V - Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"AIFMD - Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"more lis: e-money directive, SSR, MAD\/Mar, CSDR, Transparency directive, PR,  Non-Financial Reporting Directive.

The general policy statement of the Walloon Government 2019-2024 states the following: \"Tourism, whether for leisure or for business, offers numerous opportunities for economic development in varying degrees. In order to better exploit the tourist assets of Wallonia, the Government intends to: - To regard tourism as a fully-fledged economic sector that generates wealth and provides a lot of employment in Wallonia \". After all, tourism in Wallonia represents a considerable economic weight, namely: - \u20ac 2.8 billion in annual expenditure; - \u20ac 7.9 billion turnover; - \u20ac 3.6 billion gross value added, which represents 4.1% of the Walloon gross value added; - 84,000 jobs or 59,000 full-time equivalents. 2. The tourism sector is suffering greatly from the sanitary crisis, mainly due to the measures taken by the NVR. These measures were first formalized by a Ministerial Decree of 13 March 2020 on urgent measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19. Subsequently, this ministerial decision was lifted and replaced by the ministerial decision of 23 March 2020 concerning urgent measures to limit the corona virus COVID-19 (entry into force on 23 March 2020). The measures referred to are the following: \u2022 Closure of restaurants, discos, bars and cafes; \u2022 Cancellation of all recreational, cultural, folkloric, sports, private or public activities, regardless of their size; - Are closed to the public: museums, theaters, operas, cinemas, cultural centers, libraries, tourist sites, tourist services, amusement parks, indoor amusement parks, recreation centers and animal parks; - Also closed are sports or fitness rooms (internships \/ individual lessons included), swimming pools; access to such areas in hotels and holiday accommodations is also prohibited; - All mass manifestations are prohibited (carnivals, processions, exhibitions etc); cancellation of all major events such as festivals, until the end of August; \u2022 Close non-essential shops and businesses; \u2022 Non-essential movements are prohibited.

Economic vulnerabilities had been reduced, as tight fiscal policies had placed government finances on a sound footing and public debt on a downward path. Sound monetary policies and the adoption of a flexible exchange rate regime restored competitiveness, improved our external position, and allowed the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to rebuild its foreign exchange reserves. After last year\u2019s presidential and parliamentary elections, our aim was to continue sound macro-economic policies and advance structural reforms, that would deliver higher, sustainable and inclusive growth and allow incomes in Ukraine to catch up with the levels seen elsewhere in the region. As all other countries, Ukraine is now being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the resulting decline in global activity and trade, as well as the closure of capital markets. We have taken drastic, but necessary, steps to contain the spread of the virus. Starting on March 13, 2020, we have taken extensive measures to protect our population\u2019s health and support our economy. Ukraine entered this crisis with strong macro-economic fundamentals and fiscal and financial buffers. Nonetheless, the toll this crisis is taking on our economy, combined with the decline in trade and in remittances, is without precedent in modern history.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"02.06.2020","Page count":27,"Issuing body":"National Bank of Ukraine (NBU)","Country":"Ukraine","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"Base erosion and profit shifting (OECD\/ G20 BEPS)","Document Type (1)":"Letter","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/bank.gov.ua\/en\/publications?page=1&perPage=5&search=&document=&pubCategory=all&keywords=&created_from=&created_to=","Predicted document severity":"Amber","SLA due":"01.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 25.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"18.06.2020","Reg pub.

Completing the CMU has now become particularly urgent in order to speed up the EU\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. A fully-fledged CMU would help rebuild the EU\u2019s economy, by providing new funding sources for businesses and investment opportunities for Europeans. It will be vital for mobilising much-needed long-term investments in new technologies and infrastructure, to tackle climate change and to deliver Europe\u2019s New Green Deal and Digital Agenda. In today\u2019s final report, the HLF proposes 17 inter-connected \u2018game changers\u2019 \u2013 measures the EU needs to urgently implement in order to remove the biggest barriers in its capital markets. Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President of the Commission and in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union, said: \u201cThe capital markets union is a major element of our post-coronavirus recovery strategy. Savers and investors will play a vital role in getting the economy moving again and they need to have the confidence to invest through capital markets. And companies need to be able to access diversified sources of market-based financing anywhere in the EU. The Capital Markets Union can be a game changer provided we now make meaningful progress - the High-Level Expert Group has provided valuable input to make this happen. The Commission will now carefully consider each of the recommendations ahead of the next CMU Action Plan in early autumn\u201d. Thomas Wieser, Chair of the Forum added, \u201cThe report does not contain abstract ideas or high level principles that should be achieved. Rather, it has very precise and clear recommendations on what should be done in order to move Europe forward. We emphasise that this is not a menu from which one can order two or three courses, and go home satisfied. The 17 clusters of measures are mutually reinforcing, and dependent on each other\u201d. The HLF is made up of 28 high-level capital markets experts. Between now and 30 June, Commission services will seek feedback from stakeholders on today\u2019s report. John Berrigan, Director-General of Directorate General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union (DG FISMA), and Thomas Wieser are taking part today in a Twitter Live event to discuss the report in more detail.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"10.06.2020","Page count":129,"Issuing body":"European Commission (EC)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"CMU - Capital Markets Union","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"MiFID II - Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV)","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"PRIIPs - Packaged Retail Investment and Insurance-Based Investment Products","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"UCITS V - Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"LI: CSDR, MAR, Prospectus, Transparency, SSR, IDD, CRR","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/news_en?topics=354#news-block","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 25.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Rebecca","Day tracked":"18.06.2020","Reg pub.

From strategic partnerships at local and regional level, to promotion and identity projects or steps to integrate European legislation, we have continued to provide competitive services in the post-trading field of the financial market. In the context in which the financial world is constantly subject to radical transformations, everything that seems an ordinary project turns into a challenge. And, in this whirlwind of change, the Central Depository remains an essential component in the financial ecosystem in Romania, ensuring an efficient, secure and modern post-trading architecture. We remain equally involved, professionals, visionaries and innovators. We undertake, in front of all our partners and on behalf of the entire Board of Directors of the Central Depository, to maintain the services offered to a high standard and to respond with the same professionalism and enthusiasm to all expectations. Thanks to the whole team and to all the partners of the Central Depository! Dr. ec. Mihai FERCALA President of the Central Depository MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR GENERAL Dear partners, The year 2019 was under the sign of consolidating the belonging of the Romanian financial market to the big European family. It was an interesting year, with strong challenges, in which the Romanian capital market took at least two complex maturity and development exams, which it successfully completed, after several years of intense training. First of all, we were honored to actively participate and support the efforts of the Bucharest Stock Exchange to promote the Romanian capital market to the status of Emerging Market by the global index provider FTSE Russel, an achievement that met the expectations of investors, stakeholders and participants. Secondly, the authorization of the Central Depository according to the European Regulation no. 909\/2014 on improving the settlement of securities in the European Union and on the central depository of securities (CSDR), whose rules increase the transparency, security and efficiency of settlement and registry operations meant the confirmation that the post-trading services provided by the Depositary Central are perfectly aligned with European standards, are adapted to new international requirements and standards and are supported by a solid and reliable infrastructure. International cooperation at the level of associations in which the Central Depository is a member - ECSDA, ANNA, ISSA - to harmonize its activity with the new European regulatory trends and the organization in Bucharest of the Annual General Assembly ECSDA - are other steps taken by us that converge to strengthen service integration of the Central Depository in the European financial market. 2020 seems to be the year in which we will truly penetrate the meaning of the words \"solidarity\", \"team\", \"together\". It is foreshadowed to be the milestone that will set new rules, paradigms, meanings, priorities. We always talk about challenges, without imagining exactly how big or deep they can be - 2020 will certainly be a lesson in this regard. But I know that our strength, the power of adaptability, the ability to turn a borderline situation into an opportunity - all of these, combined in a joint, team effort, are an infallible formula that will take us further, no matter what. context. I believe in people, in solidarity, in our energy, in the ability to overcome any blockage. I believe in the professionals of the Romanian capital market, in its perspectives, in the Central Depository team. I believe in US! Silvia Buicanescu, General Manager, Central Depository.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"16.06.2020","Page count":15,"Issuing body":"Central Depository (Depozitarul Central) (Romania)","Country":"Romania","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"CSDR - Central Securities Depositories Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"TARGET2","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"IFRS - International Financial Reporting Standards","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"Couldn't get a solid page count from this, highlighted the whole doc and it come out to 6 pages but theres definitely more than 6","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.roclear.ro\/DespreNoi\/RapoarteAnuale","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"02.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 26.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Lucy","Day tracked":"26.06.2020","Reg pub.

Our primary focus in the first half of 2020 has been responding to the crisis provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic. ESMA, together with the national competent authorities (NCAs), has acted swiftly, taking measures to ensure stable, orderly financial markets and the protection of investors in extraordinary times. Actions taken by ESMA in response to this situation include issuing recommendations to financial market participants and our supervised entities clarifying their responsibilities during the pandemic; providing up to date risk assessments of the EU financial markets; and taking a number of actions to provide relief to market participants supporting their continuity of business in exceptional circumstances. While ESMA will continue to closely monitor the continuing impact on the financial markets, this annual report is an opportunity to reflect on our key achievements in 2019. ESMA has now existed for almost a decade; however, 2019 was also a year of renewal for the organisation. Political agreement was achieved on the amended ESMA founding regulation and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), which will significantly strengthen and expand ESMA\u2019s mandate, including its powers and responsibilities. The past year has been as much about delivering on our existing mission \u2013 to enhance investor protection and promote stable and orderly EU markets \u2013 as about preparing for the next wave of organisational change. ESMA has further expanded its focus to ensuring the consistent and effective implementation of the EU Single Rulebook and of supervisory practices across Member States. In that context, ESMA has conducted evidence-based analyses to support its review of legislation. For example, to review the Markets in Financial Instruments repealing Directive (MiFID II) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR), we have assessed the results regarding the fair access to, and lowering the cost of, market data. ESMA\u2019s focus on investor protection was a key driver in 2019, as we published our first statistical report on costs and past performance of retail investment products in the EU. Such reports enhance the analysis of key cost and performance indicators that retail investors should consider. In addition, product intervention measures related to binary options and contracts for difference taken by NCAs continued in 2019, with temporary measures taken by ESMA being replaced by permanent NCA measures. ESMA\u2019s focus on investor protection will strengthen in 2020, as it is a cornerstone of the capital markets union (CMU) and as the situation provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic raises investor protection concerns. The continued focus in the EU on the CMU will result in further initiatives to strengthen the role of capital markets in the EU financial system. Looking forward, ESMA will do its part in giving retail investors the means to understand, trust and participate in financial markets, enabling a CMU to serve EU investors and firms as well. Looking back, ESMA can also take pride in its stresssimulation framework for investment funds, to be used both by regulators to simulate stress situations for different segments of the fund industry and by ESMA itself as part of its regular risk monitoring and assessment of scenarios that could affect the robustness of the EU fund industry. The importance and value of this stress testing work has been confirmed in the current crisis. On the risk analysis front, ESMA produced its first annual report on alternative investment funds, offering the first comprehensive view of the sector while highlighting issues needing attention to support NCAs in their supervisory work. A second annual derivatives report was also produced, this time including a novel analysis of intra-group transactions. With the new mandates, much effort went into putting in place the tools necessary to apply ESMA\u2019s supervisory expertise to an enlarged scope of direct supervision that will eventually include securitisation repositories, securities financing transactions, critical benchmarks, data service providers and third-country central counterparties. Meanwhile, a follow-up on our thematic report on fees charged by credit-rating agencies (CRAs) and trade repositories was published, and a record fine was imposed on a group of EU CRAs following infringements of the CRA Regulation\u2019s conflict of interest requirements. ESMA\u2019s international work saw significant advances in 2019, with a growing role in international forums and increasing cooperation with third-country authorities. Two key results of this work were the signing of the administrative agreement between ESMA and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), allowing data transfers between regulators in and outside the European Economic Area, and our contribution to the IOSCO Market fragmentation and cross-border regulation report for the G20. Of course, one of 2019\u2019s biggest challenges was preparing for Brexit. To deal with the uncertainty surrounding its implementation, ESMA made use of its Supervisory Coordination Network to ensure that a consistent approach to authorising and supervising firms relocating from the United Kingdom to the EU27 was being taken by NCAs. ESMA also continued to monitor Brexit-associated risks, including planning for a no-deal scenario, and to make appropriate use of policy tools such as recognition decisions for central counterparties and central securities depositories to limit the potential stability risks for EU financial markets. This included agreeing a range of memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with UK competent authorities. Finally, the outcome of the European Supervisory Authorities\u2019 (ESAs) review means that sustainable finance-related responsibilities will become part of ESMA\u2019s remit. To support this, ESMA has developed a sustainable finance strategy and produced pieces of technical advice on the integration of sustainability risks and factors in MiFID II, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), and on identifying the short-term pressures that firms face to better encourage the adoption of longer term strategies. As always, I wish to express my heartfelt appreciation for all my colleagues in the Board of Supervisors, the Management Board and in the Joint Committee of the ESAs. It is thanks to their support and excellent cooperation that we were able to deliver on our objectives for this turning point of a year. I also want to acknowledge the excellent cooperation we have with the European institutions \u2013 Commission, Parliament and Council \u2013 and thank our stakeholders for the valuable contributions that they again made this year. Finally, through all the changes and uncertainties that defined 2019, ESMA staff\u2019s commitment and dedication never faltered. This spirit has already proven essential in the first half of 2020 and I look forward to facing with them the ongoing challenges that this year will bring.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"15.06.2020","Page count":84,"Issuing body":"European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"EMIR - European Market Infrastructure Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"EMIR Refit","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"MiFID II - Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"MiFIR - Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"MAD\/MAR - Market Abuse Directive\/Regulation","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"LIs: SFTR, Covid-19, CRAR, Capital Requirements Regulation, Solvency II, CSDR, AIFMD, EU Benchmarks Regulation, MMF, IFRS, PRIIPs, SSR, SR - Securitisation Regulation, UCITS V, Non-Financial Reporting Directive","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.esma.europa.eu\/search\/site\/emir","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"03.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 29.06.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"29.06.2020","Reg pub.

In its initial setup period up to 2015, its emphasis was on building a single rulebook for EU financial markets and on establishing itself as a credible direct supervisor. In accordance with ESMA\u2019s Strategic Orientation 2016-2020, ESMA has since shifted its focus increasingly onto its other two main activities: supervisory convergence and assessing risks. In 2019, the European Council, Parliament and Commission reached a political agreement on the ESAs\u2019 Review, and on EMIR 2.2. Under the Capital Markets Union (CMU), Sustainable Finance, and Fintech Actions Plans, agreement was also reached on new tasks for ESMA on Cross-border funds distribution, on the Investment Firms Framework and on the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation. The amendment of ESMA\u2019s founding regulation will transform the role of ESMA with significant impacts on its governance, organisational structure and mission from 2020. ESMA will have an enhanced role in fields such as direct supervision, supervisory convergence, investor protection, relations with third countries, and technological innovation. The second significant evolution concerns the adoption of EMIR 2.2 which will require ESMA to build capacities to implement a new regulatory framework, supervise Third Country Central Counterparties and increase its convergence role regarding EU CCPs. Much of ESMA\u2019s attention in 2020 will therefore be on ensuring that these new responsibilities, and the governance and organisational changes they imply, are initiated and developed to the highest quality standard. Strengthened by its new founding regulation, ESMA, along with the National Competent Authorities, will continue its focus on supervisory convergence, identifying areas for improved consistency of supervisory outcomes across the EU and deploying its toolbox for taking action. In particular, ESMA will continue to ensure standardised, high-quality data and will intensify work towards using its data and quantitative analysis across all its activities. Although its impact is still uncertain, it is clear that the UK\u2019s decision to withdraw from the EU will have a significant impact upon the EU\u2019s financial markets. At the time of writing, the shape of the UK\u2019s future relationship to the EU is still unknown. While ESMA\u2019s objectives of investor protection, orderly markets and financial stability will not be changed by Brexit, ESMA may need to adapt some of its activities in 2020 to new developments regarding Brexit. Given the new EU Parliament and new Commission, ESMA keeps some flexibility in its planned work programme in order to respond to potential new initiatives, such as those relating to the Capital Markets Union. Finally, since March 2020, ESMA has reallocated significant resources away from its planned work into its response to the COVID-19 crisis. This work and the implications of this are further described in this revised version of ESMA\u2019s 2020 annual work programme, which was adopted by ESMA\u2019s Board of Supervisors on 10 June 2020.

I would like to reflect on the key achievements of the Authority in\r\r\n 2019 as well as to highlight some of the opportunities and challenges\r\r\n that lie ahead of us.\r\r\n Last May, I embarked on this role as Chairperson of the EBA in the\r\r\n midst of significant changes that continue to have an impact both on\r\r\n the EBA\u2019s internal organisation and on the banking sector as a whole.\r\r\n At that time, the EBA was finalising its relocation process from London\r\r\n to Paris, which was a direct consequence of the UK\u2019s withdrawal from\r\r\n the EU. I was among the first EBA employees to inaugurate our new\r\r\n premises in La D\u00e9fense, at the Tour Europlaza.\r\r\n I must say that I was positively surprised to see how smoothly the entire\r\r\n move to Paris went and how quickly the staff adapted and settled into\r\r\n the new environment and lifestyle. For that, I am truly proud of and\r\r\n thankful to all the staff for their attitude throughout this process. I am\r\r\n also deeply grateful to the French Government and to the local authorities for their collective and untiring support throughout this journey.\r\r\n The seamless and successful move would have not been possible without their help, advice and encouragement to our staff on a daily basis.\r\r\n I am also very lucky to have inherited a strong and healthy organisation. Since its inception, the EBA has established its reputation, both\r\r\n at the European level but also globally, thanks to its technical expertise\r\r\n and unique contribution to strengthening the European banking sector, ultimately serving the public interest. The commitment, dedication\r\r\n and knowledge of our employees and the cooperation and input of our\r\r\n Members have been integral factors in the growth, success and reputation of the EBA.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"12.06.2020","Page count":120,"Issuing body":"European Banking Authority (EBA)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Basel III","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"Capital Requirements Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"BRRD - Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM)","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"MAD\/MAR - Market Abuse Directive\/Regulation","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"LI: IFD, IFR, PSD2, BMR, CRR2, CRD5, PRIIPs, SR, EMIR, CRD4, PD, DGSD, E-MD, AMLD5, MCD, COVID","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.mnb.hu\/enrss\/14","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 02.07.2020","Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Lucy","Day tracked":"02.07.2020","Reg pub.

The risks posed to domestic financial stability stem from the sudden halt in domestic activity, financial market developments, including the sharp repricing of risk premia, and structural vulnerabilities of a small open economy exposed to the downside risks in the recovery of global demand. While the starting resilience of households and firms is significantly stronger compared to the onset of the financial crisis a decade ago, the scale of the economic shock is unprecedented and will create pressure on the financial position of borrowers and lenders. The transmission of these risks to the real economy and financial system will take time and in response, policymakers have reacted with a range of fiscal, monetary, macro-prudential and micro-prudential actions to mitigate amplification and enable the financial system to support households and businesses through this crisis.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"16.06.2020","Page count":81,"Issuing body":"Central Bank Of Ireland","Country":"Ireland","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"Capital Requirements Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM)","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"Single Supervisory Mechanism - SSM","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"BRRD - Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.centralbank.ie\/news\/article\/press-release-focused-on-protecting-consumers-and-supporting-individuals-19-march-2020?utm_medium=website&utm_source=CBI-footer&utm_content=43910","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"09.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 03.07.2020","Upload date":"16.07.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/c5983b4fa76960f68256f7b3be0abc42d76717b4.xml","DDD Row Number":1118,"QA Analyst":"Min","Formatting":"Fail","Formatting \r\ncomments":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/c5983b4fa76960f68256f7b3be0abc42d76717b4.xml&fragment=i86f3f7e5e0254c13831f089137a008ac8abf566f","Formatting\/Metadata \r\nCheck time":7,"Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"03.07.2020","Reg pub.

Unlike in the global financial crisis of 2008, prior to which lending was growing rapidly, no similar market tension has been observed recently. At the same time, the resilience of the banking system has increased substantially, both by increasing banks\u2019 capital and improving risk management quality. The banking system is characterised by stable funding and high liquidity. However, due to the strength and nature of the pandemic-related shock, credit risk has increased significantly, and the risk of a credit crunch has emerged. The magnitude of the macroeconomic shock associated with the COVID-19 pandemic substantially increases the likelihood of problems with debt servicing in most credit categories. At the same time, in view of expected credit losses, whose value is uncertain, the risk of a credit crunch has emerged. This might adversely affect the real economy and, consequently, also the financial system. Measures taken by public authorities may partially reduce the risk of a credit crunch. Public fiscal stabilization measures directly and indirectly support financial stability. The financial support for companies provided in response to the shock triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak and substantial loosening of monetary policy, including NBP\u2019s interest rate cuts, reduce the solvency risk of companies and households. This, in effect, reduces credit losses of banks. At the same time, a release of the systemic risk buffer in the amount of approx. 30 billion zlotys, recommended by the FSC-M and implemented by the Minister of Finances act, gives banks a significant amounts of funds to maintain lending. However, the risk of a credit crunch depends not only on the scope and length of human contact restrictions and the efficiency of the government support measures that affect loan demand, but also on decisions taken by banks and their credit risk perception. The COVID-19-related shock negatively affects the weaknesses of the financial system identified in previous editions of the Report and also creates new risk areas that will affect financial system stability. The materialisation of risk associated with consumer loans may pose a material source of credit losses for banks. Consumer loans are riskier than the rest of the credit loans portfolio and constitute a significant share (16% of credit to non-financial sector and approx. 9% of GDP) of banks\u2019 loans compared to other EU countries. In addition, high-value consumer loans account for a significant portion of the consumer loans portfolio and, given the current shock, may prove to be particularly vulnerable to the economic downturn.

Its\r\r\n function as the foremost funding currency is reinforced by its use as a vehicle currency\r\r\n for foreign exchange transactions, invoicing currency for global trade and reserve\r\r\n currency for reserve managers. This widespread use of the US dollar gives rise to a\r\r\n complex and geographically dispersed network of funding relationships. These\r\r\n interconnections generate significant benefits, in terms of lower costs for the\r\r\n international flow of capital and the distribution of risk, but also give rise to\r\r\n vulnerabilities in terms of the transmission and amplification of shocks emanating\r\r\n from the United States or elsewhere, across the globe.\r\r\n The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) mandated a Working\r\r\n Group co-chaired by Sally Davies (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)\r\r\n and Christopher Kent (Reserve Bank of Australia) to take stock of the structure and\r\r\n evolution the US dollar funding market since the global financial crisis (GFC) and to\r\r\n assess its resilience. The group also identified implications for policy with a focus on\r\r\n non-US entities both inside and outside the United States.\r\r\n This report presents the Group\u2019s findings. The growing share of the US dollar in\r\r\n international borrowing has been accompanied by major changes in the structure of\r\r\n the US dollar funding landscape. After the GFC, geographical weights have shifted\r\r\n and bank intermediation has ceded space to market-based finance and non-banks.\r\r\n Banks have become more resilient, they have lower bilateral credit exposures and\r\r\n access to liquidity swap lines that provide a prudent liquidity backstop. Typically, nonbanks are less leveraged than banks, but have access to fewer sources of US dollar\r\r\n funding (including through central bank facilities). As such, they are more likely to act\r\r\n as amplifiers of market volatility if subjected to stresses. Limited visibility of activities\r\r\n of non-banks present obstacles to the assessment of systemic risk. Moreover, crossborder and cross-sector linkages complicate efforts to monitor and manage the risk\r\r\n of a retrenchment in cross-border liquidity. The report suggests that more complete\r\r\n data collection could help reduce vulnerabilities. The report also identifies regulatory\r\r\n and structural policy options that could further reduce certain vulnerabilities.\r\r\n The bulk of the work was conducted prior to the outbreak of Covid-19. The\r\r\n ensuing crisis validated many of the messages of the report, but it also had an\r\r\n important impact on US dollar funding activity. The report provides some pertinent,\r\r\n albeit necessarily preliminary, observations in this regard.\r\r\n I hope that policymakers, researchers and market participants will find this report\r\r\n useful as they are looking to learn from the experience of the past decade, and\r\r\n consider ways to better monitor the role of US dollar funding in the global financial\r\r\n system and to improve the resilience of institutions involved in the related activities.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"18.06.2020","Page count":87,"Issuing body":"Bank of International Settlements (BIS)","Country":"International","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Basel III","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"Solvency II Directive","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"EMIR - European Market Infrastructure Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"SFTR - Securities Financing Transactions Regulation","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.bis.org\/list\/cgfs\/index.htm?m=3%7C15%7C569","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"13.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 07.07.2020","Upload date":"07.08.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/5fe39de6f314bd457ba138a11760a0c92f403728.xml","DDD Row Number":1283,"Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"07.07.2020","Reg pub.

An increase in the application of protective trade policies, geopolitical risks and interpolar variances in policies had a negative impact on recovery. Growing concerns in the second half resulted with the developed countries switching back to expansionary monetary policies. The risk perception was high throughout the year. Deployment of expansionary monetary policies by the central banks of developed countries due to growth and inflation concerns supported the global finance and resulted with the capital being diverted to developing countries. Oil prices followed a fluctuating course. The impact of geopolitical risks continually increased. Economic weaknesses in the EU continued and Brexit had a negative impact on the expectations and courses of action. Under the influence of these developments, the global economy is estimated to have grown by 2.9 percent in 2019. The growth rate was 1.7 percent in developed countries and around 3.7 percent in developing countries.

I am pleased to present a review of the operating environment and our Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 to our shareholders, members of the Board of Directors, management and colleagues. Inflationary pressures remained in 2019, starting at 11.37% in January before falling to an all- year low in August at 11.02% and surging to 11.98% in December 2019. This spike was largely driven by the continuous rise of food inflation due to the closure of the borders since August 2019. Other players in the retail spaces were retailers in the specialty, furniture and fashion industries; expansions to other mall locations were largely driven by local retail operations while a few international brands made their way into the market. These included Dodo Pizza, a Russian food outlet chain, and Swarovski which took up some retail spaces in the mall locations. The global economy witnessed some turbulence in 2019, with the intensified US-China trade war, and Brexit delays influencing the growth story significantly. Despite external factors, the Nigerian economy showed marginal improvement in 2019 relative to 2018. Nigeria's GDP grew by 2.27% in 2019, 0.36% points higher than 2018 driven by the following sectors: Information & Communication, Agriculture, Financial & Insurance Services and Manufacturing. DEVELOPMENTS IN PROPERTY INDUSTRY Oil prices witnessed volatility throughout the year due to tensions between the US and Iraq as well as escalated trade wars between the US and China. Fiscal and monetary efforts resulted in the stability of exchange rates which averaged N362.5 to the dollar in 2019 across the different windows. The performance of the real estate sector declined significantly from 0.93% in Q1 2019 to -3.45% in Q4 2019, contributing 6.21% to real GDP in Q4 2019 (39 bps lower than its contribution in Q4 2018). In the full year, the sector recorded a share of 6.12% of total real GDP in 2019, down from 6.41% in 2018. Supply in the property market was boosted with opening of the Landmark Retail Boulevard, coming in at roughly 8,000 square metres of retail space. Others include the Osogbo Mall in Osun and the Simbiat Mall in Lagos (both approximately 5,000 square metres).

It takes this opportunity to comment on the impact of the coronavirus crisis, in particular on investment funds and on investment funds. pension and to set out the actions it has taken in the context of this crisis. The FSMA's essential mission is to contribute to the honest and fair treatment of the financial consumer and to ensure the transparency of the financial markets. Its areas of expertise revolve around six axes: control of financial products, control of compliance with rules of conduct, market surveillance, control of financial service providers and intermediaries, control of supplementary pensions and contribution to public financial education. During the coronavirus crisis, the FSMA paid particular attention to monitoring the impact of this crisis on Belgian investment funds and pension funds, of which it intensified surveillance. This exercise revealed that it was in mid-March that investment funds suffered the most significant repercussions of the crisis: the value of their assets then decreased by 16% compared to that noted at the end of 2019. The situation then recovered. At the beginning of June, the fall in the assets of investment funds was only 4% compared to the end of 2019. As for the average coverage rates of pension funds, they also did well resisted. At the beginning of June, the coverage of short-term and long-term commitments of these funds amounted to 144% and 117% respectively, In addition to strict supervision of the financial markets, the FSMA took care to provide the necessary guidance to the entities subject to its control and to inform consumers. As part of its consumer protection mission, the FSMA launched a campaign against online investment fraud last week. Fraudsters do not hesitate to exploit the news around the Covid-19 pandemic to make new victims. More information on this campaign is provided in a separate press release .

In order to give a taste of the Wikifin Lab, the FSMA annual report is illustrated with photos taken on the spot.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"22.06.2020","Page count":212,"Issuing body":"Belgium Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA)","Country":"Belgium","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"PR - Prospectus Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"Insurance Distribution Directive","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"PRIIPs - Packaged Retail Investment and Insurance-Based Investment Products","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"EMIR - European Market Infrastructure Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"lis: MIFID II,  PSD2, UCITS IV, Transparency Directive, MAD\/MAR - Market Abuse Directive\/Regulation, EU Benchmark Regulation, IORP II - Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision II Directive","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.fsma.be\/fr\/news-articles","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"13.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 07.07.2020","Upload date":"07.08.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/bc8c239e2fe3c899eaa3466b5a80b55e7bf9b1ad.xml","DDD Row Number":1295,"Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Lucy","Day tracked":"06.07.2020","Reg pub.

The Regulation introduces extremely granular daily reporting requirements for repos and other types of SFTs, which pose a significant challenge for the industry. In total, SFTR sets out 155 reporting fields (118 are applicable to repo), most of which require the data from both sides of the trade to match with no or very limited tolerance.

The prevalent view among industry participants is that when an issuer chooses the competitive offering method over the negotiated offering method or the private placement method, it is in the interest of the issuer to solicit as many bids as possible from competing underwriters or underwriter syndicates. Presumably, when underwriters compete to win the offering at a cost of sacrificing the profit margin, the issuer would benefit from the competition by selling the securities at the most advantageous price, or the lowest yield. There has been, however, scant research literature in recent years empirically investigating the relationship between competitive bidding activities and the resulting primary offering profit margin earned by the winning bidder from reselling. This paper analyzes two aspects of the competitive offering process in recent years: 1) the average number of competitive bids received by an issuer; and 2) the impact of the bidding competition on winning underwriters\u2019 profit margins. We found that the average number of competitive bids received gradually increased over the past 10 years, from an average of 4.4 competitive bids per issuance in 2009 to an average of 5.7 competitive bids per issuance in the first half of 2019. This conclusion holds regardless of the size of an issuance, the population of the state where the issuance originated (referred to in this paper as \u201cissuance origination state\u201d) or the per capita income level of an issuance origination state. In addition, we found that the winning bidder\u2019s primary offering spread was negatively correlated with the number of competitive bids received after controlling for characteristics of each offering, such as offering size, time to maturity and yield, etc. Therefore, all things being equal, soliciting more competitive bids does indeed improve an issuer\u2019s selling price and reduce the yield cost for the issuer. We caution that the conclusion from this paper is preliminary and may warrant further investigation, such as further exploring immediate trading in the secondary market during the first 30 days subsequent to the initial offerings.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"07.07.2020","Page count":27,"Issuing body":"Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)","Country":"United States","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Other","Document Type (1)":"Whitepaper","Orignal Links":"http:\/\/www.msrb.org\/Market-Topics\/Reports.aspx","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 20.07.2020","Upload date":"07.08.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/74f3dcd3fbbd2b2368a003c643b5d301e328d174.xml","DDD Row Number":1715,"Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"20.07.2020","Reg pub.

This trend has spawned numerous empirical studies seeking to come up with evidence on price adjustment and explain inflation dynamics. Despite the significant progress that has now been made and the broad coverage of countries examined1 , the bulk of the existing literature covers the 1990s and early 2000s, with pertinent evidence as of the more recent period being scarce 2 . Importantly, while the 1990s and early 2000s span the period characterised by robust GDP growth and inflation rates close to target levels (i.e. the \u201cGreat Moderation\u201d) in most advanced economies, subsequent years have been marked by the financial crisis of 2007 and the ensuing global GDP and trade collapse, the 2010-2012 euro area sovereign debt crisis with its regional and global side effects and the low inflation environment in the euro area as of 2013. As a result, these events have rendered even more compelling the need of policy-makers and academics alike to understand how micro-level prices have been set in recent years and inform monetary policy accordingly. Our main objective in this article is to contribute on this front. Exploiting a new release of micro-level CPI (Consumer Price Index) data of monthly frequency for Belgium over the period from January 2007 to December 2015, we provide evidence on how frequently prices adjust, how large these adjustments are, and the time- and state-dependent aspects of these adjustments. The patterns and trends that we identify are summarised in six stylised facts and are broadly consistent with those documented in the existing literature.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"16.07.2020","Page count":24,"Issuing body":"National Bank of Belgium","Country":"Belgium","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.nbb.be\/en\/publications-and-research\/economicfinancial-publications\/last-publications","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 20.07.2020","Upload date":"28.07.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/3ba33271dbfb665cc8d6741c62bc3253e40e9c05.xml","DDD Row Number":1716,"Expected delivery date_1":"BAU backlog"},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"20.07.2020","Reg pub.

In the same period, demand for loans increased considerably in the case of firms and decreased considerably in the case of households. For the third quarter of the year, banks foresee tighter credit standards on loans to enterprises, mainly SME, and on consumer credit. On the demand side, an increase on the firm segment and a virtual stabilization on the household segment are expected. Supply In the second quarter of 2020, credit standards on loans to firms and households became tighter when compared to the previous quarter, especially on long-term loans, in the case of firms, and on consumer credit, in the case of households (Chart 1). Contributing to these developments were banks\u2019 risk tolerance and the perception of risks associated to the general economic situation and outlook, borrower\u2019s creditworthiness and, additionally, the risk related to collateral demanded, in the case of firm credit. Correspondingly, there was a tightening of collateral requirements on firm loans and on the loan margin applied on SME loans of higher risk and a slight tightening on the \u201cloan-to-value\u201d ratio on housing loans. The share of loan applications that were rejected increased in both credit segments, but more so in the household segment, both in housing and consumer credit. For the third quarter of 2020, banks foresee tighter credit standards on loans to SME and slightly tighter credit standards on consumer loans. Demand In the second quarter of 2020, demand for loans to firms increased considerably, mainly in the SME segment and in long-term loans and, in contrast, demand for loans to households decreased considerably, in both credit types but mainly in consumer credit (Chart 2). The increase in firms\u2019 loan demand was motivated by inventories and working capital financing and, to a lesser extent, by debt refinancing or renegotiation and by the financing need created by the current situation in what regards internal financing. In turn, fixed investment financing contributed to a decrease in demand. Consumer confidence was the main factor pointed out for the decrease in households\u2019 loan demand, in addition to spending on durable consumer goods, in the case of consumer credit, and housing market prospects, in the case of housing loans. For the third quarter of 2020, banks foresee an increase in loan demand from firms, common to all firm types and loan maturities, and a virtual stabilization in the case of households","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"14.07.2020","Page count":32,"Issuing body":"Bank of Portugal (Banco de Portugal)","Country":"Portugal","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.bportugal.pt\/en\/publications\/banco-de-portugal","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 21.07.2020","Upload date":"28.07.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/7c324fc5f254544bd016cd56e5f31d950af17e6a.xml","DDD Row Number":1735},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"15.07.2020","Reg pub.

The Federal Debt Agency publishes the financial operations it has carried out as well as the evolution of the structure of the federal debt that results from the rigorous management it achieves. As usual, a particular chapter was devoted to the strategic points which characterized the year under review. Four points were retained by the Agency: the dismantling and total elimination of the debt in unhedged foreign currencies; the use of \"optional reverse inquiries\" (ORI), which consists of a facility for performing auctions of linear bonds under certain conditions; the decrease in the number of dealers active in our public debt; the publication of reports relating to the green OLO issued by the Kingdom of Belgium in the context of climate change. This annual report also deals with Belgian economic developments and public finances. In 2019, Belgium posted a growth rate of 1.4%, exceeding the growth rate of the euro zone (1.2%) for the first time since 2014. We must note positive factors in this development such as the level of our demand domestic as well as a further improvement in employment and a decrease in the unemployment rate which fell to 5.4% of the active population in 2019. In terms of public finances, Belgium's deficit in 2019 was 1.9% of the GDP. Our state\u2019s debt ratio has dropped to 98.7% of GDP, below 100%. To cover its financing needs, the Agency issued medium and long-term loans in 2019 for an amount of 30.30 billion euros: 29.74 billion in OLO, 0.55 billion in EMTN and almost 4 million euros in bonds of State. In addition, posting 16.37 years, the average duration of the Agency's issues remained very high in 2019 and the average duration of the federal debt in euros increased from 9.62 years in 2018 to 9.81 years in 2019. Finally, in a context of very low interest rates, interest charges on the federal public debt continued to decrease and went from 8.66 billion to 8.36 billion euros between 2018 and 2019. The weighted average interest rate on the debt instruments in euros increased from 2.17% at the end of 2018 to 2.00% at the end of the year under review. I will close this foreword with appreciation for the high level of professionalism that the Federal Debt Agency has continued to demonstrate in its debt management mission.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"17.06.2020","Page count":71,"Issuing body":"Belgian Debt Agency","Country":"Belgium","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Other","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"hub","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.debtagency.be\/fr\/downloadsannualreport","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 21.07.2020","Upload date":"28.07.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/9830d99fb7007c7f2c5f7fb11b782112e6305623.xml","DDD Row Number":1738},{"Analyst Name":"Rebecca","Day tracked":"15.07.2020","Reg pub.

Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) provides an alternative insolvency regime for the orderly liquidation of large financial companies that meet specified criteria. Section 205 of Title II sets forth certain provisions specific to the orderly liquidation of certain large broker-dealers, and paragraph (h) of section 205 requires the Agencies, in consultation with the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d), jointly to issue rules to implement section 205. In the case of a broker-dealer, or a financial company4 in which the largest U.S. subsidiary is a broker-dealer, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (\u201cBoard\u201d) and the Commission are authorized jointly to issue a written orderly liquidation recommendation to the U.S. Treasury Secretary (\u201cSecretary\u201d). The FDIC must be consulted in such a case. The recommendation, which may be sua sponte or at the request of the Secretary, must contain a discussion regarding eight criteria enumerated in section 203(a)(2) and be approved by a vote of not fewer than a two-thirds majority of the Board then serving and a two-thirds majority of the Commission then serving. Based on similar but not identical criteria enumerated in section 203(b), the Secretary would consider the recommendation and (in consultation with the President) determine whether the financial company poses a systemic risk meriting liquidation under Title II. Title II also provides that in any case in which the Corporation is appointed receiver for a covered financial company, the Corporation may appoint itself receiver for any covered subsidiary if the Corporation and the Secretary make the requisite joint determination specified in section 210. A company that is the subject of an affirmative section 203(b) (or section 210(a)(1)(E)) determination would be considered a covered financial company for purposes of Title II. As discussed below, a covered broker or dealer is a covered financial company that is registered with the Commission as a broker or dealer and is a member of SIPC. Under the process specified in section 203 or 210, the broker-dealer will be a \u201ccovered broker-dealer,\u201d section 205 and the final rule will apply, the covered broker-dealer will be placed into orderly liquidation, and the FDIC will be appointed receiver. The FDIC and the SEC jointly published for public comment a notice of proposed rulemaking titled \u201cCovered Broker-Dealer Provisions under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\u201d in the Federal Register on March 2, 2016. The 60-day comment period ended on May 2, 2016.15 In keeping with the statutory mandate, the proposed rule, among other things, (i) clarified how the relevant provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (\u201cSIPA\u201d) would be incorporated into a Title II proceeding, (ii) specified the purpose and the content of the application for a protective decree required by section 205(a)(2)(A) of the Dodd-Frank Act, (iii) clarified the FDIC\u2019s power as receiver with respect to the transfer of assets of a covered broker-dealer to a bridge broker-dealer, (iv) specified the roles of the FDIC as receiver and SIPC as trustee with respect to a covered broker-dealer, (v) described the claims process applicable to customers and other creditors of a covered broker-dealer, (vi) provided for SIPC\u2019s administrative expenses, and (vii) provided that the treatment of qualified financial contracts (\u201cQFCs\u201d) of the covered broker-dealer would be governed exclusively by section 210 of the Dodd-Frank Act.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"24.07.2020","Page count":113,"Issuing body":"Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)","Country":"United States","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"RFA - Regulatory Flexibility Act","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"Securities Exchange Act","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA)","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"CFR Title 12 - Banks and Banking","Document Type (1)":"Final Rule","Analyst comments":"Li; CFR 17: IB; FDIC","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/rules\/rulemaking-index.shtml","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"31.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 27.07.2020","Upload date":"07.08.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/4a46fe38821bd52742792ef012fcceac8151118f.xml","DDD Row Number":1905},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"27.07.2020","Reg pub.

The amendments add conditions to the availability of certain existing exemptions from the information and filing requirements of the Federal proxy rules that are commonly used by proxy voting advice businesses. These conditions require compliance with disclosure and procedural requirements, including conflicts of interest disclosures by proxy voting advice businesses and two principles-based requirements. The first principles-based requirement calls for proxy voting advice businesses to adopt written policies and procedures designed to ensure that the proxy voting advice is made available to registrants. The second principles-based requirement calls for proxy voting advice businesses to adopt written policies and procedures designed to ensure that they provide clients with a mechanism by which the clients can reasonably be expected to become aware of a registrant\u2019s views about the proxy voting advice so that they can take such views into account as they vote proxies. Although the requirements are principlesbased, the amendments provide a non-exclusive list of methods, or safe harbors, that satisfy the conditions to the exemptions. In addition, the amendments codify the Commission\u2019s interpretation that proxy voting advice generally constitutes a solicitation within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

While banks are generally well aware of the complexity of the reforms and the challenges involved, their level of preparation leaves room for improvement, according to the survey. Banks are also generally behind schedule in implementing risk mitigation measures. The assessment of the survey results, which was conducted by ECB Banking Supervision, also revealed that banks had focused more on the transition from the euro overnight index average (EONIA) to the euro short-term rate (\u20acSTR) than on the risks associated with the reform of the euro interbank offered rate (EURIBOR). This is despite the fact that EURIBOR is currently the most frequently used benchmark rate for contracts in the euro area. To assist banks in their preparation, ECB Banking Supervision is publishing good practices outlining how banks can best structure their benchmark-rate related governance, identify benchmark-rate related risks, and create action plans and documentation in relation to the reforms. Given the widespread use of benchmark interest rates such as EONIA, EURIBOR and LIBOR in financial contracts, it is also critical that banks update the contracts that reference these rates in good time.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"23.07.2020","Page count":17,"Issuing body":"European Central Bank (ECB)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"EU Benchmark Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"SONIA - Sterling Overnight Index Average","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"Single Supervisory Mechanism - SSM","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"IBOR Transition","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.banque-france.fr\/sites\/default\/files\/medias\/documents\/2020-07-23_-_pr_-_ecb_publishes_good_practices_for_banks_to_prepare_for_benchmark_rate_reforms.pdf","Predicted document severity":"Amber","SLA due":"31.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 27.07.2020","Upload date":"07.08.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/7107e8b166dafc58161bbddd114cb42101b5cda3.xml","DDD Row Number":1936},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"27.07.2020","Reg pub.

The pandemic gave rise to an extreme economic shock affecting the global and EU economy and financial stability. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, EU bodies, national governments, central banks, and supervisory and resolution authorities took unprecedented action to support the economy. The ESRB General Board identified and took measures in five priority areas: the implications for the financial system of guarantee schemes and other fiscal measures to protect the real economy; market illiquidity and its implications for asset managers and insurers; the impact of procyclical downgrades of bonds on markets and entities across the financial system; system-wide restraints on dividend payments, share buybacks and other payouts; and liquidity risks arising from margin calls.3 As these measures were taken in May 2020, which is outside the review period of this report, they will be described in the 2020 Annual Report. In June 2020 the ESRB reviewed its systemic risk assessment to account for recent developments. It classified the risk of widespread defaults in the real economy as a severe systemic risk to financial stability in the EU (Risk 1); the risk originating from the difficult macroeconomic environment for banks, insurers and pension schemes as an elevated risk to financial stability (Risk 2); the risk stemming from the re-emergence of sovereign financing risk and debt sustainability concerns as elevated (Risk 3); and the risk originating from instability and pockets of illiquidity in financial markets as elevated (Risk 4). Moreover, the ESRB deemed operational risks, such as might originate from a system-wide cyber incident, as elevated (Risk 5), while it assessed that systemic risks linked to finance-driven disruptions in critical financial infrastructures (Risk 6) and risks linked to climate change (Risk 7) should be monitored. Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ESRB issued five warnings and six recommendations on medium-term residential real estate sector vulnerabilities to competent ministers in eleven of its member jurisdictions. In addition, it amended an earlier recommendation on closing real estate data gaps. The ESRB continued to contribute to the coordination of macroprudential policy in the Union. In view of the need to intensify the collaboration between the authorities of the host and home Member States in situations where branches are considered important for the financial stability of the country in which they operate, the ESRB issued a recommendation promoting the exchange of data on branches. The ESRB also provided an opinion to the Council, the European Commission and Finland, noting that it deemed an extension of a stricter national measure by Finland necessary for the effective treatment of the systemic risks and the threats deriving from the Finnish housing market. The ESRB also applied its reciprocity framework and recommended reciprocation of national flexibility measures for residential real estate exposures in Belgium, Estonia and the Netherlands. More generally, the ESRB continued to monitor macroprudential measures adopted in the Union and to facilitate an exchange of views among its members on such measures. These measures are described in more detail in the ESRB\u2019s review of macroprudential policy in the EU.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"23.07.2020","Page count":39,"Issuing body":"European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"AIFMD - Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"ESRB Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"EMIR - European Market Infrastructure Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"Capital Requirements Regulation","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"LI: EMIR REFIT, SOLVENCY II, IFRS","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.esrb.europa.eu\/pub\/ar\/html\/index.en.html","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"31.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 27.07.2020","Upload date":"30.07.2020","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/8b714575950122513f48296814a297846174b6b3.xml","DDD Row Number":1957,"QA Analyst":"Darryl","Formatting":"Fail","Formatting \r\ncomments":"Inconsistant text throughout","Formatting\/Metadata \r\nCheck time":2},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"27.07.2020","Reg pub.

The virus combines (at least) three shocks: health, financial and economic, causing one of the deepest crises ever seen in peacetime. Governments around the world quickly took unprecedented measures to fight the pandemic, with the top priority being the containment of the virus, closely followed by limitation of the financial panic and economic fallout, in which they were aided by central banks and supervisors. This article focuses on the initial actions taken by the European Central Bank (ECB) 1 to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. The first section outlines the context: the global spread of the virus sent financial markets into turmoil, while the lockdown measures implemented by countries to mitigate the spread of the virus resulted in large shortterm economic losses. Looking ahead, the macroeconomic outlook is extremely uncertain. The second section highlights the complementarity of the measures taken by fiscal, monetary and supervisory authorities around the world, which helped to curb the financial panic and cushion the economic fallout caused by COVID-19. Sections three and four focus on the ECB\u2019s monetary policy decisions taken during the first half of 2020. In order to achieve its primary objective \u2013 maintaining price stability \u2013 the ECB pursued three main goals: ensuring an overall sufficiently accommodative stance, supporting market stabilisation to safeguard the transmission mechanism and providing ample central bank liquidity, especially to maintain credit provision (Lane, 2020). Asset purchases were stepped up, both under the existing Asset Purchase Programme and by launching a new, temporary Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. The ECB also gave banks more scope for borrowing liquidity under its longerterm refinancing operations, while simultaneously easing its collateral requirements. Finally, enhanced US dollar and euro swap and repo lines mitigated pressures in global funding markets. The focus is on the motivation, purpose and impact of these measures rather than on their technical details. The final section concludes, and discusses the challenges posed for monetary policy by a low-economic growth and high-debt environment. While policymakers have steered the economy relatively well through the depth of the crisis, their task is far from over and may well become even more complex.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"17.07.2020","Page count":16,"Issuing body":"European Central Bank (ECB)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":"IB: National Bank of Belgium","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.nbb.be\/en\/publications-and-research\/economicfinancial-publications\/last-publications","Predicted document severity":"Amber","SLA due":"31.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 27.07.2020","DDD Row Number":1967},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"27.07.2020","Reg pub.

Our initial analysis, outlined in last year\u2019s Discussion Paper (DP19\/2), illustrated how entrenched the financial differences between generations have become over the last 30 years. Since then, the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has dramatically reshaped the lives of most people, including their financial lives. Some have described it as a great leveller for society; I disagree. Going into the crisis, there was wide disparity in financial circumstances, reflected in our unique financial needs. This hasn\u2019t changed. Coronavirus may have changed our circumstances and needs, but it hasn\u2019t reduced our differences. This is especially true when looking across generations. Many entering retirement face particularly complex choices at a time of market volatility. Meanwhile, younger people leaving school, college and university in Summer 2020 are entering an uncertain labour market, often while carrying significant debt. At the FCA, we have taken short-term steps to support consumers through this uncertainty, including policy action on payment deferrals for unsecured lending and mortgages, as well as support for insurance policyholders. Evolving consumer needs during the crisis, and how this differs across generations, is a critical component of our development and evaluation of these measures. It is too early to robustly interpret the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic. We are starting to see some data on how the initial phase of the pandemic has impacted our financial lives, and this broadly points to an amplification of the findings in this paper. But evolving socio-economic conditions mean that it is too soon to assume that this data provides a blueprint for the next phase of the pandemic. As such, the analysis within this paper does not seek to evaluate the intergenerational impact of coronavirus. Instead, the analysis provides a benchmark, based on historic trends over the past 30 years, of how consumer needs across generations could be better met by the market. We are taking two steps to bring our findings from this work into our wider regulatory approach. Firstly, earlier in 2020 we set medium-term business priorities that are tied to responding to many of the issues identified through this work. Secondly, we will use our findings to continuously monitor and re-evaluate the financial needs, circumstances and lives of different generations through future consumer and economic research. We hope that by publishing this analysis now, it will be a useful tool for market participants during the recovery phase of the crisis, ensuring the long-term response is one that meets consumer needs across generations, and that ultimately allows us to build a better future.

We are making these proposals now because of the exceptional circumstances caused by the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis, which has significantly affected a wide range of companies, including many which are issuers of securities. The ESEF initiative aims to enhance the transparency of financial data disclosed by issuers whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on EU regulated markets. Under ESEF, issuers will \u2018mark-up\u2019 their annual financial reports with electronic tags to make them machine readable. This will make easier the process of evaluating corporate performance by investors across industry sectors and different jurisdictions. This will help to improve the long-term effectiveness of European capital markets and, therefore reduce the cost of capital. We fully support the ESEF initiative. The rules implementing the ESEF requirements are already in place. Issuers must publish their annual financial reports in the ESEF format from the start of 2021 for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2020. To meet these requirements issuers will need to devote potentially significant management and operational time, especially in the second half of this year. The exceptional circumstances of the coronavirus crisis have already put significant pressures on issuers. In this context, and in line with our other recent actions to relieve burdens on issuers, our proposed changes to the ESEF application timetable will allow issuers to focus on their more immediate and significant priorities. Issuers will, however, be able to publish and file their annual financial reports voluntarily in the new ESEF if they choose to do so. We also intend to continue with our programme of investment in the National Storage Mechanism to support the initiative.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"22.07.2020","Public response date":"28.08.2020","Page count":27,"Issuing body":"Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)","Country":"United Kingdom","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"PR - Prospectus Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"Transparency Directive","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"Financial Service and Markets Act 2000","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"IFRS - International Financial Reporting Standards","Document Type (1)":"Consultation","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.fca.org.uk\/publications\/search-results?np_category=policy%20and%20guidance%2Cpolicy%20and%20guidance-policy%20statements%2Cpolicy%20and%20guidance-finalised%20guidance%2Cpolicy%20and%20guidance-consultation%20papers%2Cpolicy%20and%20guidance-guidance%20consultations%2Cpolicy%20and%20guidance-feedback%20statements%2Cpolicy%20and%20guidance-discussion%20papers%2Cpolicy%20and%20guidance-calls%20for%20input%2Cpolicy%20and%20guidance-handbook%2Cpolicy%20and%20guidance-newsletters&start=1","Predicted document severity":"Amber","SLA due":"31.07.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 27.07.2020","DDD Row Number":2000},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"27.07.2020","Reg pub.

The basic instrument of the monetary policy in 2019 was the short-term interest rate \u2013 the NBP reference rate. By setting the level of the NBP reference rate, the Monetary Policy Council (MPC) determines the yields on the monetary policy instruments. Changes in the level of this rate determine the course of monetary policy and affect the path of market rates. The deposit rate and the lombard rate set the fluctuation band for overnight interest rates in the interbank market, which is symmetric with respect to the reference rate. In 2019, the Monetary Policy Council made no changes in interest rates. The last change took place in March 2015. Throughout 2019 the NBP reference rate stood at 1.5%, the deposit rate at 0.5%, and the lombard rate at 2.5%. NBP implemented the monetary policy guidelines adopted by the MPC by carrying out open market operations through which it affected banking sector liquidity in a manner allowing short-term market rates to be maintained at a level conducive to the achievement of the inflation target assumed by the MPC. In 2019, the main open market operations involved the issuance of 7-day NBP bills on a regular basis. The fine-tuning operations involved the regular (on the last working day of the reserve maintenance period) and ad-hoc (during the reserve maintenance period) issuance of NBP bills with shorter maturities than the main operations, and were aimed to reduce the volatility of short-term market interest rates. Access to the open market operations, the main ones and the regularly conducted fine- -tuning ones, was granted to all banks complying with the terms and conditions set by NBP. Moreover, the Bank Guarantee Fund (BFG) had access to the main open market operations too. Banks operating as Money Market Dealers (MMD) had access to the ad-hoc fine-tuning operations. In 2019, 12 banks most active in both the money and foreign exchange markets enjoyed the status of a Money Market Dealer. Commercial banks also had the possibility of using standing facilities, placed at their disposal by NBP, to facilitate their short-term liquidity management. Banks were able to deposit excess funds with NBP via overnight deposit facility and cover liquidity shortages via the marginal lending facility. In 2019, NBP did not carry out any structural operations targeted at a long-term change in banking sector liquidity. In the year under consideration, there was a decrease in short-term liquidity of the banking sector, measured as the average annual balance of central bank operations, i.e. main and fine-tuning open market operations as well as standing facilities.

The Penny Pilot was initiated at the then existing option exchanges in January 20073 and was expanded and extended numerous times over the last 13 years. In each instance, these approvals relied upon the consideration of data periodically provided by the Exchanges that analyzed how quoting options in penny increments affects spreads, liquidity, quote traffic, and volume.

However, whilst writing this document, the global and European economies entered a period of turmoil and unprecedented uncertainty due to Coronavirus, addressed with containment measures having largescale economic effects. It is too soon to expand on the possible consequences of these measures on the EU's economy and DG ECFIN's work. On 27 February 2019, the Commission adopted the European Semester winter package setting out policy priorities at the European level. In this year\u2019s package, the Commission launched a discussion on investment challenges and priorities in the Member States and set out first ideas as to how EU funds can help in the forthcoming programming period 2021-2027. This new focus is reflected throughout the country reports. In June, the Commission adopted the European Semester spring package with country-specific recommendations to all EU Member States for the next 12 to 18 months. The recommendations underline well-targeted investment strategies and responsible fiscal policies in modernising the European economy. Separately, a Commission recommendation prepared by ECFIN led the Council to abrogate the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) for Spain, the last from the crisis period. The Commission adopted the autumn fiscal package in November, comprising a Communication on the overall assessment of the 2020 Draft Budgetary Plans (DBPs) and Opinions on the DBPs of all euro area countries. No Member State shows particularly serious non-compliance with the SGP but 8 Member States do risk non-compliance. In December, the 1st package of the von der Leyen Commission on the European Semester was presented. In it, the Annual Sustainable Growth Strategy (ASGS) delivers on the vision set out in President von der Leyen's Political Guidelines, encompassing symbiotic dimensions to address long-term challenges: i) environmental sustainability; ii) productivity gains; iii) fairness; and iv) macroeconomic stability.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"25.06.2020","Page count":43,"Issuing body":"European Commission (EC)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/info\/publications_en?field_core_nal_countries_tid_selective=All&field_core_departments_target_id_selective=All&field_publication_type_tid_selective=129","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"03.08.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 28.07.2020","DDD Row Number":2094},{"Analyst Name":"Darryl","Day tracked":"28.07.2020","Reg pub.

Taking into account the protection measures in place to contain the health emergency, instead of usual reading in public of the President's Considerations, COVIP has also released today, always on its website, a video message containing the salient elements of these Considerations. In addition to illustrating the state of the supervised sectors (pension funds and professional funds) - whose resources have exceeded a total of 270 billion euros covering over ten millions of subjects between registered and retired - the President of COVIP focused on evolutionary perspectives of these sectors, also in light of the current situation. **** PENSION FUNDS \u2022 The offer At the end of 2019, there are 380 pension funds in Italy: 33 negotiating funds, 41 open funds, 70 individual pension plans (PIP), 235 pre-existing funds, in addition to Fondinps being overcome. The number of pension forms operating in the system is constantly decreasing. Twenty years ago, in 1999, there were 739 operating forms, almost double. \u2022 Subscribers and memberships At the end of 2019, the total number of members of the supplementary pension scheme is around 8.3 million, up 4% on the previous year, for a coverage rate of 31.4% of the total of the labor force. The existing positions are 9.1 million (inclusive of double or multiple positions, which are headed to the same subscriber). Subscribers to the \"new\" PIPs amounted to 3.3 million, 3.1 million to negotiating funds, over 1.5 million those to open funds and about 600,000 those to pre-existing funds. Men are 61.9% of those enrolled in supplementary pensions (73.4% in negotiating funds), in the wake of that gender gap that has already manifested itself in past years.

The Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD) has updated the Guide on the use of cookies to adapt it to the Consent Guidelines modified in May 2020 by the European Data Protection Committee (CEPD). As with previous versions, the new version of the Guide carried out by the Agency has had the participation of the affected sectors (the ADIGITAL associations, the Spanish Association of Advertisers, AUTOCONTROL and IAB Spain).\r\r\n\r\r\n The European Data Protection Committee has revised in May 2020 the Guidelines 05\/2020 on consent in order to clarify its position in relation to two issues: the validity of the option \u201ccontinue browsing\u201d as a way of giving consent on the part of of users and the possibility of using the so-called \"cookie walls\", that is, of limiting access to certain services or content only to users who accept the use of cookies.\r\r\n\r\r\n Regarding the first of these points, the Committee considers that the option to \u201ccontinue browsing\u201d does not constitute, under any circumstances, a valid way of giving consent , insofar as such actions may be difficult to distinguish from other activities or interactions. of the user, so it would not be possible to understand that consent is unequivocal.\r\r\n\r\r\n Regarding the \u201ccookie walls\u201d, the Committee has specified that, for consent to be considered freely granted, access to the service and its functionalities should not be conditioned on the user consenting to the use of cookies.\r\r\n\r\r\n For this reason, the Guide makes explicit that the so-called \u201ccookie walls\u201d that do not offer an alternative to consent may not be used . This criterion is especially important in those cases in which the denial of access would prevent the exercise of a legally recognized right to the user. For example, access to a website is the only means provided to the user to exercise this right.\r\r\n\r\r\n There may be certain cases in which the non-acceptance of the use of cookies prevents access to the website or the total or partial use of the service, provided that the user is adequately informed about it and an alternative access to the service is offered without need. to accept the use of cookies. As established in the Guidelines 05\/2020 on the consent of the CEPD, the services of both alternatives must be genuinely equivalent, and in addition it will not be valid that the equivalent service is offered by an entity other than the publisher.\r\r\n\r\r\n These new criteria must be implemented no later than October 31 of this year , thus establishing a transitional period of three months to introduce the necessary changes in the mechanisms for obtaining consent for the use of cookies that are being used.","State":"Final text","Effective date":"31.10.2020","Issue Date":"28.07.2020","Page count":39,"Issuing body":"Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos (AEPD))","Country":"Spain","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)","Document Type (1)":"Guidance","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.aepd.es\/es\/prensa-y-comunicacion\/notas-de-prensa","Predicted document severity":"Green","SLA due":"04.08.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 29.07.2020","DDD Row Number":2109},{"Analyst Name":"Lucy","Day tracked":"29.07.2020","Reg pub.

The article presents model-based analyzes that deal with this Deal with the issue. With a view to the long-term drivers of the German current account shows that the demographic development in Germany means long-term savings noticeably stimulates and thus has a positive impact on the current account. The Germans are also likely to Labor market reforms at the beginning of the 2000s contributed to the rising current account balance. The recent very high surplus is not only due to structural factors. Macroeconomic models, the short to medium-term deviations from long-term structural current account positions explain the increase lead to various influences back. These include increased domestic savings, especially among companies. Though restrained investment activity also played a role; quantitatively, however, it was less significant. In addition, external influences were decisive, including increased foreign demand for German products. Before the global financial and economic crisis in 2008 the surplus increased particularly in trade with countries in the euro area. After that the Growth driven by demand from countries outside Europe. Furthermore, policy measures to reduce the current account surplus are examined in simulations using several macroeconomic models. It turns out that one fiscal expansion in Germany would reduce the current account surplus. Indeed most models have limited effects. Structural reforms in the German service sector would also tend to reduce the current account balance. Your However, the impact would be even weaker. The simulations suggest that changes can exert significant influences in an international environment. So dampen an appreciation of the Euro or a slump in growth in China noticeable the German current account balance. Given For a noticeable reduction of the surplus, purely national measures in plausible orders of magnitude are not sufficient. A substantial reduction in the surplus also requires changes in the international environment. It is not obvious to Germany that bad political developments are responsible for the high surplus. That's why it is it is also not expedient to take targeted measures to reduce the balance. Nevertheless, generally sensible and appropriate measures can also reduce the surplus. The current projection of the Bundesbank sees a significant decline in the German current account surplus of more against the background of the coronavirus pandemic than 7% of gross domestic product to less than 5% this year and by the end of 2022 none A further breach of the 6% mark of the EU imbalance procedure ahead. Although in In the model scenarios no Covid 19 shock was simulated, this projection is basically in Consistent with the model simulations. As a result of the pandemic, global economic output weakened significantly, international trade slumped, and Chinese growth The economy slowed down considerably and German fiscal policy steered to cope of the pandemic consequences on a strong expansion course.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"27.07.2020","Page count":148,"Issuing body":"Deutsche Bundesbank","Country":"Germany ","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.bundesbank.de\/de\/publikationen\/berichte\/monatsberichte","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"04.08.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 29.07.2020","DDD Row Number":2151},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"29.07.2020","Reg pub.

The purpose of this SS is to set out the PRA\u2019s approach to its supervision of building societies\u2019 lending and treasury activities. The SS aims to build on the principle that the risk appetites of building societies should be properly aligned to their risk capacity, in order to promote the safety and soundness of building societies as deposit-taking institutions. The SS describes the key lending and treasury risks to which societies are exposed, and sets out a framework describing different potential models (\u2018approaches\u2019) for managing and controlling these risks. There are three approaches for lending (\u2018Traditional\u2019, \u2018Limited\u2019, \u2018Mitigated\u2019) and four approaches for treasury (\u2018Administered\u2019, \u2018Matched\u2019, \u2018Extended\u2019, \u2018Comprehensive\u2019). The SS is designed to provide clarity on supervisory expectations for the risk management characteristics and organisation that should be in place commensurate with the level and types of risk taken by each building society. The PRA expects each building society to adopt the approaches (lending and treasury) that are most appropriate to its business model and risk management capabilities, recognising that the small scale of some building societies may preclude having a separate risk management function \u2013 and therefore limit the types of activities that they can undertake prudently.

It is addressed to firms to which CRD IV1 applies. The statement should be read alongside the \u2018Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment\u2019 part of the PRA Rulebook (ILAA rules), the \u2018Liquidity Coverage Requirement \u2014 UK Designated Investment Firms\u2019 part of the PRA Rulebook; the PRA\u2019s approach to banking supervision; Part Six (Liquidity) of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the European Commission Delegated Act with regards to the liquidity coverage requirement (LCR) for credit institutions (\u2018Delegated Act\u2019). The PRA\u2019s approach is informed by the European Banking Authority\u2019s (EBA\u2019s) guidelines for common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP).4 The PRA expects firms to have regard to the detail contained in Titles 8 and 9 of the EBA SREP Guidelines to understand the PRA\u2019s expectations of them in respect of liquidity and funding risk management and control. The Delegated Act specifies in detail the LCR provided for in CRR Article 412 and is directly applicable in the United Kingdom. It took effect from 1 October 2015. The Delegated Act only applies to credit institutions. PRA-designated investment firms must comply with the obligations laid down in the Delegated Act as they apply to credit institutions, by virtue of rule 2.1 of the \u2018LCR \u2014 UK designated investment firms\u2019 Part of the PRA Rulebook. They should read references in this statement to the Delegated Act accordingly. The PRA is required under CRD IV to apply the Liquidity Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (L-SREP) and any supervisory measures in accordance with the level of application of the requirements set out in the CRD IV framework. Therefore, the ILAA rules, including the requirement to carry out an Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), apply on an individual basis and on a consolidated basis where firms must comply with Part Six (Liquidity) of the CRR on a consolidated basis. This enables the PRA to apply the L-SREP and any supervisory measures at both individual and consolidated level, where appropriate.

Those uniform disclosure formats shall convey sufficiently comprehensive and comparable information for users of that information to assess the risk profiles of institutions and their degree of compliance with the requirements laid down in Parts One to Seven. To facilitate the comparability of information, the ITS shall seek to maintain consistency of disclosure formats with international standards on disclosures. Following the new mandate, the EBA has updated its strategy regarding its policy on institutions\u2019 Pillar 3 disclosures, in order to foster the role of institutions\u2019 disclosures in promoting market discipline through, among other actions, the development of a comprehensive ITS on disclosure. The key goals of this strategy and of the new ITS are: a. Optimise the Pillar 3 policy framework to provide a single comprehensive package, improving clarity for users of information. b. Promote market discipline further, by increasing the consistency and comparability of theinformation disclosed by institutions, and its alignment with the new regulatory changes introduced by Regulation (EU) 2019\/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR2)) and with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) revised Pillar 3 disclosure framework. c. Facilitate access by users of information to institutions\u2019 key prudential data by introducing the new key metrics templates. d. Foster ease of implementation for institutions by facilitating their access to, and understanding of, all the disclosure templates and tables. e. Increase the efficiency of disclosures by institutions and reduce costs via technology, through the integration of quantitative disclosure data and supervisory reporting. For this purpose the EBA is developing several all-inclusive regulatory disclosure products, including the comprehensive draft ITS on institutions\u2019 public disclosures, applicable to all institutions subject to the disclosure requirements under Part Eight of the CRR, which is the subject of this final report.

Their main aim has been to correct credit institutions\u2019 weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis. Recently, there has been a greater focus on conduct-related short comings and activities in offshore financial centres. Sound internal governance arrangements are fundamental if credit institutions individually and the banking system they form are to operate well. Directive 2013\/36\/EU, as amended by Directive 2019\/878\/EU,reinforces the governance requirements for credit institutions and in particular stresses the responsibility of the management body for sound governance arrangements; the importance of a strong supervisory function that challenges management decision-making; and the need to establish and implement a sound risk strategy and risk management framework. To further harmonise credit institutions\u2019 internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU in line with the requirements introduced by Directive 2013\/36\/EU, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is mandated by Article 74(3) of Directive 2013\/36\/EU, to develop guidelines in this area. The guidelines apply to all credit institutions regardless of their governance structures (unitary board, dual board or other structure), without advocating or preferring any specific structure, as set out specifically in the scope of application. The guidelines apply in the same way as to credit institutions to investment firms that are subject to Title VII of Directive 2013\/36\/EU in application of Article 1(2) and (5) of Regulation 2019\/2033\/EU.

In an unprecedented move, federal, state and local governments purposely shut down economic activity to prevent the spread of the virus. Everything from restaurants to theme parks to manufacturing plants closed, and people holed up in their homes. The world as we knew it stopped. By April, economic statistics painted a bleak picture. The U.S. lost over 23 million jobs, with the reported U3 unemployment rate at 14.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The U6 statistics1 provided a more accurate, yet more negative, measure of true unemployment: over 36 million unemployed, 22.8% unemployment rate. Then came a May surprise. May total nonfarm payroll employment actually rose by 2.5 million, with the unemployment rate declining to 13.3%, reflecting a limited resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed in March and April due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Markets started to rebound, as shown by volatility coming down, volumes heading back to normal levels and index prices recovering. But just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell tempered market enthusiasm. He indicated Fed projections were that the U.S. would end 2020 with an unemployment rate of 9.3%, with \u201cwell into the millions of people who don\u2019t get to go back to their old job or there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time\u201d. In light of the economic uncertainty, the Fed pledged to keep interest rates near zero through 2022 and continue its bond-buying programs for the foreseeable future. Powell noted, \u201cThe extent of the downturn and the pace of recovery remain extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus.\u201d On this report, market metrics reversed course from their recovery.

Uncertainty in the global economic evolution represents a risk for all the countries and, in particular, for the approximately 550 entities supervised by the Financial Supervisory Authority (162 legal entities on the capital market, 319 legal entities on the insurance market and 73 legal entities on the private pension market). Since February-March this year, in just a few weeks the global economic landscape has changed radically, from estimates of increases in gross domestic product (GDP) of up to 4-5% in some countries, reaching declines up to -9\/-10% (International Monetary Fund), in some cases, for 2020. Unemployment has risen sharply, the incomes of a large part of the global population have fallen sharply or disappeared overnight, being influenced by the closure of some entire economic sectors. All countries of the world are looking for solutions of support for the companies affected and for the population. The persistence of the health crisis will emphasize the risks, leading to growing imbalances. Therefore, the balance and financial stability since the publication of the last Report on Non-bank Financial Stability are changed and must be viewed from a different angle. FSA has a flexible, adaptable and proactive approach in order to be able to mitigate the emerging risks in such a short period of time. The financial system is a cross-border one and is connected to the European one, first of all, and to the global one, secondly. Therefore, the global turbulence is influencing both the local financial market and the real economy by spreading the contagion. A number of factors have amplified the assets volatility in all the markets, contributing to the sharp tightening of financial conditions in a very short time. Since the beginning of the crisis, the Authority has taken a number of measures in order to combat the COVID-19 crisis, which are aimed at maintaining the stability of the non-bank financial system. The risk approach has evolved, becoming more complex, taking into account both macro risks (topdown approach) as well as micro risks (bottom-up approach), going to the emerging risks related to climate change and, recently, to the risks related to the pandemic.

The pandemic gave rise to an extreme economic shock affecting the global and EU economy and financial stability. Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, EU bodies, national governments, central banks, and supervisory and resolution authorities took unprecedented action to support the economy. The ESRB General Board identified and took measures in five priority areas: the implications for the financial system of guarantee schemes and other fiscal measures to protect the real economy; market illiquidity and its implications for asset managers and insurers; the impact of procyclical downgrades of bonds on markets and entities across the financial system; system-wide restraints on dividend payments, share buybacks and other payouts; and liquidity risks arising from margin calls.3 As these measures were taken in May 2020, which is outside the review period of this report, they will be described in the 2020 Annual Report. In June 2020 the ESRB reviewed its systemic risk assessment to account for recent developments. It classified the risk of widespread defaults in the real economy as a severe systemic risk to financial stability in the EU (Risk 1); the risk originating from the difficult macroeconomic environment for banks, insurers and pension schemes as an elevated risk to financial stability (Risk 2); the risk stemming from the re-emergence of sovereign financing risk and debt sustainability concerns as elevated (Risk 3); and the risk originating from instability and pockets of illiquidity in financial markets as elevated (Risk 4). Moreover, the ESRB deemed operational risks, such as might originate from a system-wide cyber incident, as elevated (Risk 5), while it assessed that systemic risks linked to finance-driven disruptions in critical financial infrastructures (Risk 6) and risks linked to climate change (Risk 7) should be monitored. Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ESRB issued five warnings and six recommendations on medium-term residential real estate sector vulnerabilities to competent ministers in eleven of its member jurisdictions. In addition, it amended an earlier recommendation on closing real estate data gaps.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"03.08.2020","Page count":39,"Issuing body":"European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB)","Country":"EU (All Member States)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"EMIR - European Market Infrastructure Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (3)":"EMIR Refit","Legislative Initiatives (4)":"Capital Requirements Regulation","Legislative Initiatives (5)":"AIFMD - Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive","Document Type (1)":"Report","Analyst comments":" LI; Solvency II; ESRB Regulation; SSM; CRD V; IFRS;BRRD","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.bde.es\/bde\/en\/utiles\/Canal_RSS\/noticias\/","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"11.08.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 05.08.2020"},{"Analyst Name":"Matt","Day tracked":"04.08.2020","Reg pub.

Credit standards are understood as minimum standards of creditworthiness, set by banks, that the borrower is required to meet to obtain a loan. Terms on loans are the features of the loan agreement between the bank and the borrower, including spread, non-interest loan costs, maximum loan size, collateral requirements and maximum loan maturity. The survey is addressed to the chairpersons of banks\u2019 credit committees. Banks\u2019 responses may not take account of the opinions of banks\u2019 divisions other than the credit divisions. The survey was conducted at the beginning of July 2020 among 24 banks with a total share of approx. 88% of loans to enterprises and households in the banking sector\u2019s portfolio. The aggregation of data behind the results consisted in the calculation of weighted percentages of responses and the net percentage, i.e. the difference between the structures presenting opposite trends. In line with the adopted methodology, words describing quantities (majority, half, considerable, significant, percentage of the banks, etc.) refer to weighted percentages and not to the number of banks. Thus, the phrase \u201cthe majority of banks\u201d should be understood as \u201cthe asset-weighted majority of banks\u201d.

Within this, the active communication of the monetary authority with the public has an essential role, the main instrument used for this purpose by the National Bank of Romania being the Inflation Report. In addition to analyzing the latest economic, monetary and financial developments and explaining the reasons and manner of implementation of monetary policy in the previous period, the Report presents the quarterly projection of the National Bank of Romania on the evolution of inflation over an eight-quarter horizon - including the uncertainties and risks associated with it - and assesses the recent and future macroeconomic context from the perspective of the monetary policy decision. By compiling and publishing quarterly - in accordance with the frequency of the forecast cycle - of the Inflation Report, the National Bank of Romania aims to offer all those interested the opportunity to better understand its analysis framework and implicitly the fundamentals of monetary policy decisions. Ensuring the transparency and predictability of monetary policy is likely to strengthen the credibility of monetary policy and thus help to effectively anchor inflation expectations and reduce the costs of ensuring and maintaining price stability. The analysis presented in the Inflation Report is based on the latest available statistical information at the time of writing, so that the reference periods of the indicators used are different. The inflation report was approved at the NBR Board meeting on 5 August 2020, and the macroeconomic projection was made on the basis of information available until 3 August 2020.

By May 2020, JR schemes supported about 50 million jobs across the OECD, about ten times as during the global financial crisis. JR schemes seek to preserve jobs at firms experiencing a temporary reduction in business activity by alleviating firms\u2019 labour costs while supporting the incomes of workers whose hours are reduced. They can take the form of short-time work (STW) schemes that directly subsidise hours not worked, such as the German Kurzarbeitor the French Activit\u00e9partielle.They can also take the form of wage subsidy (WS) schemes that subsidise hours worked but can also be used to top up the earnings of workers on reduced hours, such as the Dutch Emergency Bridging Measure (Noodmatregel Overbrugging Werkgelegenheid, NOW) or the Job Keeper Payment in Australia. Acrucial aspect of all JR schemes is that employees keep their contracts with the employer even if their work is suspended.In the early stages of the COVID-19 crisis, the over riding concern for governments has been to help firms and workers deal with the sudden and unpredictable decline if not full shut-down in business activity resulting from the government-imposed restrictions to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus. To maximise take up, many governments have modified existing JR schemes or introduced new ones. These schemes providethe necessary liquidity to firms to hold on to their workers, including their talent and experience, and allows them to ramp up operations quickly once economic activity recovers, without having to go through the process of hiring and training new workers. However, as countries move out of the strict confinement phase, policy makers have to strike the right balance between ensuring adequate support for jobs that are temporarily unviable and limiting the extent to which subsidies reach jobs that would be preserved anyway or that are unviable in the long term.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"03.08.2020","Page count":23,"Issuing body":"Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)","Country":"International","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Legislative Initiatives (2)":"Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act)","Document Type (1)":"Policy Statement","Orignal Links":"http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/coronavirus\/en\/#id-7","Predicted document severity":"Amber","SLA due":"11.08.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 06.08.2020"},{"Analyst Name":"Lucy","Day tracked":"06.08.2020","Reg pub.

At its meeting ending on 4 August 2020, the MPC voted unanimously to maintain Bank Rate at 0.1%. The Committee voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with its existing programmes of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, maintaining the target for the total stock of these purchases at \u00a3745 billion. The Committee\u2019s projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying August Monetary Policy Report. Although recent developments suggest a less weak starting point for the Committee\u2019s latest projections, it is unclear how informative they are about how the economy will perform further out. The outlook for the UK and global economies remains unusually uncertain. It will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how governments, households and businesses respond to these factors. The MPC\u2019s projections assume that the direct impact of Covid-19 on the economy dissipates gradually over the forecast period.

The Covid-19 pandemic is having a severely disruptive economic impact, with repercussions for UK households and businesses. The FPC is focused on ensuring that the financial system does not amplify economic stress, and that its resilience is put to good effect in the service of the UK economy during this period. The performance of the UK financial system during the pandemic UK households and businesses have needed support from the financial system to weather the economic disruption associated with Covid-19. Reflecting the resilience that has been built up since the global financial crisis and, alongside the extraordinary policy responses of the Government and of the Bank of England, the financial system has so far been able to provide that support. The Committee estimates that, under the central projection in the August 2020 Monetary Policy Report (MPR), companies could face a cash-flow deficit of up to around \u00a3200 billion. Although in aggregate they hold substantial buffers of cash, many UK businesses have needed additional financing to minimise the impact on employment and productive capacity. With government-backed loan guarantee schemes in place, the financial system has met the initial surge in demand for credit. Stabilised by central bank actions, financial market functioning has recovered after an abrupt and disruptive \u2018dash for cash\u2019 in March. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, businesses have raised over \u00a370 billion of net additional financing from banks \u2015 primarily through government-backed loan guarantee schemes \u2015 and through access to financial markets. Over the same period, they have borrowed \u00a318 billion through the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF). UK households entered the Covid-19 shock in a stronger financial position than at the start of the global financial crisis, in part due to financial policies that have guarded against an increase in the number of highly indebted households. This has been further supported by 1.9 million mortgage payment holidays granted to households, so that debt-servicing pressures remain low overall. It will be important for lenders to work flexibly with borrowers as they resume repayments.

The draft decision aims to temporarily lower the maximum credit allowance due to the consequences of COVID-19. The surcharge on the statutory interest is reduced from 12 percentage points to 8 percentage points. This is intended to protect consumers against the high costs of credit during the corona crisis. The Advisory Division of the Council of State understands the background and purpose of this decision, but comments on the consideration of the possible effects of the reduction of the maximum credit allowance. As the explanatory memorandum does not contain any further reasoning for the choice made in the draft decision, it is currently not possible to assess whether the draft decision strikes an acceptable balance between the desired reduction in credit compensation for the protection of consumers and its possible adverse effects.

The Service Standards are applied upon receipt of a completed application and do not include the time taken by an applicant to address matters raised by the Central Bank during the process. There are some exceptional circumstances where Service Standards targets set out do not apply. Full details on the types of exceptions are set out in Appendix B. There are 44 Service Standards against which the Central Bank sets performance targets. Some Service Standards may not be relevant during the reporting period \u2013 i.e. if no applications were submitted to the Central Bank in that period. During this period, there were 10 Service Standards which were not relevant (indicated as \u2018N\/A\u2019 in the relevant tables). The Service Standards were met or exceeded in all 34 of the applicable targets with the Central Bank assessing over 5,500 applications\/submissions.

Renewed\r\r\n outbreaks are also occurring in some other\r\r\n countries, including Japan and parts of Australia.\r\r\n The ongoing spread of the virus, and the\r\r\n responses to contain it, will combine to slow the\r\r\n recovery.\r\r\n The Australian economy has experienced a\r\r\n severe contraction and, like many other\r\r\n economies, is now in the early stages of\r\r\n recovery. The contraction over the first half of\r\r\n 2020 was smaller than anticipated three months\r\r\n ago, though it was still very large. It was also not\r\r\n quite as large as in some other economies,\r\r\n where lockdown measures were more binding\r\r\n and were imposed for longer. However, the pace\r\r\n of recovery is expected to be slower than\r\r\n previously forecast. Generalised uncertainty and\r\r\n deficiency in demand have turned out to be\r\r\n more of a drag on growth than previously\r\r\n thought. The measures taken to address the\r\r\n current outbreak in Victoria will further delay the\r\r\n recovery. The most recently announced\r\r\n containment measures are expected to subtract\r\r\n at least 2 percentage points from national\r\r\n growth in the September quarter, relative to the\r\r\n counterfactual where the renewed outbreak had\r\r\n not occurred.\r\r\n In light of the extreme uncertainty about the\r\r\n course of the pandemic and its economic\r\r\n effects, the outlook is again considered in the\r\r\n form of three scenarios. In the baseline scenario,\r\r\n the Australian economy is expected to contract\r\r\n by about 6 per cent over 2020, before growing\r\r\n by around 5 per cent over 2021 and 4 per cent\r\r\n over 2022. This would still leave the level of\r\r\n output below where it would have been had the\r\r\n pandemic not occurred. Under the baseline\r\r\n scenario, the unemployment rate is expected to\r\r\n peak at around 10 per cent by the end of this\r\r\n year.\r\r\n A stronger economic recovery is possible if faster\r\r\n progress in controlling the virus is achieved in\r\r\n the near term. In this scenario, a faster\r\r\n unwinding of activity restrictions and greater\r\r\n confidence lead to a faster recovery in\r\r\n consumption, investment and employment. The\r\r\n unemployment rate would peak at a lower level\r\r\n and decline faster than in the baseline scenario.\r\r\n However, a plausible downside scenario is where\r\r\n the world experiences a widespread resurgence\r\r\n in infections in the near term, and Australia itself\r\r\n faces further outbreaks and lockdowns in certain\r\r\n areas. Activity restrictions would weigh on \r\r\n household consumption and business\r\r\n investment decisions, despite continued policy\r\r\n stimulus and income support measures.\r\r\n Domestic activity would take much longer to\r\r\n recover in this scenario, resulting in the\r\r\n unemployment rate remaining close to its peak\r\r\n throughout 2021.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"06.08.2020","Page count":104,"Issuing body":"Reserve Bank of Australia","Country":"Australia","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID 19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Statement","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.rba.gov.au\/publications\/smp\/2020\/aug\/","Predicted document severity":"Red","SLA due":"13.08.2020","QA Comments":"Sent to DDD on 07.08.2020"},{"Analyst Name":"Min","Day tracked":"07.08.2020","Reg pub.

In line with the FSB Key Attributes1 , the BRRD introduced recovery and resolution planning, as well as gave specific tools and powers to resolution authorities allowing for failing institutionsto be resolved instead of applying normal insolvency procedures. In addition, the BRRD introduced early intervention measures (EIMs) which were added to the supervisory measures already established by Directive 2013\/36\/EU (CRD), Regulation 1024\/2013 (SSM\u2010R) or national law (supervisory powers). Early intervention constitutes one of the three pillars of the BRRD: preparation (i.e. recovery and resolution planning), early intervention and resolution. Without pre\u2010empting the outcome of future legislative discussions with respect to potential future revisions of the BRRD, the EBA sees significant merit in raising issues stemming from the implementation of the early intervention framework in the BRRD, as well as in the context of other existing supervisory powers, in order to highlight high\u2010priority issues. Moreover, the examination of the implementation of the EIMs enables the EBA to assess the existing practices in applying the EBA Guidelines on triggers for use of early intervention measures pursuant to Article 27(4) BRRD2 (thereafter referred to as GL on EI triggers). This examination will be essential for deciding whether there is a need to use the possibility given in Article 27(5) BRRD for the EBA to replace the current GL on EI triggers with regulatory technical standards (RTS) issued on the same topic, taking into account experience acquired in the application of the GL on EI triggers. In this Discussion Paper (DP), the EBA introduces some of the most important implementation issues in the area of EIMs. The DP intends to provide preliminary views on how those implementation issues could be addressed and, at the same time, gives stakeholders the opportunity to provide early input.

While cybersecurity has mainly been viewed as a technology issue, it is now also regarded as a key environmental, social and governance (ESG) concern, falling under the \u201cSocial\u201d pillar.

HKIMR Applied Research reports are released on topics that are highly relevant to market participants and regulators in Hong Kong, and they aim to provide insights on the long-term development strategy and direction of Hong Kong\u2019s financial services industry. The report describes the recent transformation of the financial services industry using artificial intelligence (AI) and big data (BD) technologies, and highlights the role of talent integrating these new technologies into the financial services industry\u2019s core business functions. The report also explores market participants\u2019 views on AI\/BD adoption and the demand for talent in major Asia-Pacific financial centres in a survey commissioned by the HKIMR. The findings suggest that 71% of firms across sectors of the financial services industry in the region have either adopted or planned to adopt AI\/BD technologies in the next 12 months. Market participants identify clear benefits from AI\/BD adoption, but they also highlight that the shortage of talent is one of the key challenges now and in the next 5 years. The report also presents market participants\u2019 views on promoting talent development and reviews the relevant initiatives implemented internationally and in Hong Kong. The report is concluded by suggestions aimed to enrich Hong Kong\u2019s pool of talent, including strategies to narrow the existing talent gap, support talent recruitment as well as foster talent development.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"28.10.2021","Page count":70,"Issuing body":"Hong Kong Academy of Finance (AoF) \u2013 (\u91d1\u878d\u5b66\u9662)","Country":"Hong Kong","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"COVID-19 - Global Pandemic","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.hkma.gov.hk\/eng\/news-and-media\/press-releases\/2021\/10\/20211028-3\/","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"DO NOT PUBLISH","Upload owner":"DDD","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/e5b98718140a828a98359d98584de1449165aaaa.xml","Expected delivery date":"10.11.2021","Delivery Date":"10.11.2021","QA Metadata Analyst":"Samuel","Can you confirm that the metadata of the document is assigned correctly in RegDelta?":"Yes","Formatting":"Pass | To Publish","Formatting \r\ncomments":"DO NOT PUBLISH"},{"Project":"Library Request - Italy","Analyst Name":"Maxwell","Day tracked":44504,"Reg pub.

The topic of energy consumption of blockchains and especially of the Bitcoin blockchain has recently triggered a lot of discussions and a debate has started on the topic of making Bitcoin a sustainable ecosystem. Although the Bitcoin is currently in the spotlight, this thematic report does not only focus on Proof-of-Work blockchain solutions, but also analyses the whole spectrum of blockchain technologies. In this respect the various consensus mechanisms are analysed with regards to their energy consumption, but also other aspects of the consensus protocols are taken into account, such as security and throughput, that are deemed important when considering the application of blockchain solutions in real-world use cases. With regards to the energy efficiency of blockchain technologies, the thematic report presents the various approaches and methodologies that address the challenge of estimating the energy consumption of the Bitcoin blockchains. It should be mentioned that although the report is focusing upon the whole spectrum of consensus mechanisms, due to the high energy consumption of Bitcoin blockchain, only methodologies that analyse the energy consumption of the Bitcoin are available and, thus, covered in the report. Apart from the various diverse applications of blockchain technologies across several sectors ranging from finance and supply chain to the pharmaceutical and energy sectors, cryptocurrencies on the various blockchains are constantly under the spotlight. To also address the topic of cryptocurrencies, the thematic report also deals with the topic of the energy efficiency of the ICT infrastructure that is used for cryptocurrency mining.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"01.10.2021","Page count":55,"Issuing body":"European Commission (EC)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu\/en\/library\/eu-blockchain-observatory-and-forum-publishes-report-energy-efficiency-blockchain-technologies","Predicted document severity":"Red","QA Comments":"DO NOT PUBLISH","Upload owner":"DDD","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/922055bd63962557c59a12615350367921ab8fdd.xml","Expected delivery date":"10.11.2021","Delivery Date":"10.11.2021","QA Metadata Analyst":"Samuel","Can you confirm that the metadata of the document is assigned correctly in RegDelta?":"Yes","Formatting":"Pass | To Publish","Formatting \r\ncomments":"DO NOT PUBLISH"},{"Project":"Internal project - Swift","Analyst Name":"Lucy","Day tracked":44505,"Reg pub.

Not-despite a slight decline, inflationary expectations of the population and business all are still high, which creates risks of increased secondary pro-inflationary effects from rising prices. Lending activity is still expanding rapidly. For the reaction of the population's deposit activity to an increase in interest rates on banking contributions take time. The growth of nominal wages accelerated to double digit wages against the background of an outstripping increase in demand for labor. It is strongly supports the growth of domestic demand and serves as a source of inflation risks in the context of the continuing lag in the response of the supply of goods and services to increase demand.

Our model combines nominal rigidities and capital accumulation, features that have usually been studied separately in previous literature. In our model, we show that agents do not internalize how their asset purchases affect asset prices. Thus, when crises occur, there are fire sales: less demand for capital further reduces prices and agents are worse off. Policy interventions (both monetary and macroprudential)can improve allocations by restricting borrowing ex-ante (during the accumulation of risks and imbalances) and stimulating the economy ex-post (during crises).As a result, we find a complementary relationship between ex-ante monetary policy and preventive macroprudential policy. We also compare this result with a flexible-price model and a frictionless model and conduct several sensitivity analysis exercises.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"24.09.2021","Page count":53,"Issuing body":"Central Bank of Russia (CBR)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Other","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.cbr.ru\/ec_research\/ser\/wp_80\/","Predicted document severity":"Red","Upload owner":"DDD","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/396cb98a3766676bab62f694dde349605f48747c.xml","Expected delivery date":"29.12.2021","Delivery Date":"29.12.2021","QA Metadata Analyst":"Peter","Can you confirm that the metadata of the document is assigned correctly in RegDelta?":"Yes","Formatting":"Pass|To Publish"},{"Project":"Library Request - Russia","Analyst Name":"Maxwell","Day tracked":44519,"Reg pub.

It is known that information on transactions of clients of banks \/ payment systems \/ retail platforms is a useful source for assessing the credit risk of potential borrowers. Thus, strategic behavior of a large player with a large client base and occupying a large share of payments \/ deposits, can affect the characteristics of the market lending. In this article, within the framework of a game-theoretic model, we discover what is dominance maybe influence on sectoral structure, financial availability, pricing and accepted credit risks in the lending market. Our results show that the dominance of the deposit market in the digital economy can lead to changes in the structure of the loan market. Information asymmetries allow the dominant player to increase his profit by reducing the profit of other players(banks). At the same time, the availability of credit for borrowers with a high level of risk decreases, and banks' credit risks are decreasing.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"20.09.2021","Page count":52,"Issuing body":"Central Bank of Russia (CBR)","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Other","Document Type (1)":"Report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.cbr.ru\/ec_research\/ser\/wp_78\/","Predicted document severity":"Red","Upload owner":"DDD"},{"Project":"Library Request - Italy","Analyst Name":"Steve","Day tracked":44522,"Reg pub.

In that context, we compare how Ireland\u2019s experience has related to that of other European and OECD countries. Housing represents one of the largest single outlays for households as well as one of the largest sources of wealth for most owner occupiers. We show household debt burdens in Ireland are now closer to other European countries having been above average in the past. We highlight that mortgage and rental burdens in Ireland \u2013 although uneven across the household income distribution \u2013 are broadly comparable to those of other OECD countries. We find that house price valuations relative to incomes and to a lesser extent rents remain elevated relative to history, but nowhere near the levels preceding the housing crash and are slightly lower than two to three years ago. We also examine the relative affordability of acquiring home-ownership in a cross-country context, by constructing a series of national house price to income ratios and find that, on average, the current Irish level is in-line with many other developed economies. This is not to say that housing in Ireland is inexpensiveon an absolute basis but in placing the Irish data in a broader international context we show that the housing affordability pressures appear to be part of a wider set of global challenging trends in housing markets. This note mainly focuses on averages and does not examine the issue of housing affordability of individuals where experiences are likely to vary widely depending on income and within country regional dynamics.

Lending increased continuously between 2014 and 2019 to almost \u20ac10 billion per year, before declining in 2020 amid COVID-19. During the 2010s, income growth among firsttime buyers exceeded growth in average incomes, and the average homebuyer was older than previously, reflecting challenges to affordability and pent-up demand after low home purchase volumes during the early 2010s. The mortgage measures reduced lending at high LTI and LTV ratios, assisted by more cautious risk appetites among lenders and borrowers. Around 20 per cent of lending is above the LTI and LTV limits in the mortgage measures, typically offered to relatively young borrowers in Dublin. A growing share of lending is at or close to the LTI and LTV limits. In 2020, 20 per cent of lending was at the LTI limit and 40 per cent was at the LTV limit. This indicates that in the absence of the mortgage measures, new lending would have involved higher levels of indebtedness, especially among first-time buyers and borrowers earning average or low incomes.

An understanding of their effects, both intended and unintended, is continuously evolving. In this Note, we discuss the macroeconomic channels though which such measures, like all economic policies, can both benefit and impose costs on the economy. System-wide benefits of such measures arise predominantly through the taming of housing-credit cycles, which lower both the probability and the severity of financial recessions, as well as avoiding resource misallocation. Such crises have been shown to have particularly harmful effects, are followed by slow recoveries and can have persistent adverse macroeconomic effects. The macroeconomic costs of such measures operate through liquidity constraints on renters, and reductions in consumption and construction activity that may arise through dampened house prices and expectations. These macroeconomic costs are more likely to be short-term, and less likely to affect the productive capacity of the economy in the long-run.","State":"Final text","Issue Date":"05.10.2021","Page count":20,"Issuing body":"Central Bank Of Ireland","Legislative Initiatives (1)":"Other","Document Type (1)":"report","Orignal Links":"https:\/\/www.centralbank.ie\/","Predicted document severity":"Green","Upload owner":"DDD","Content URL":"https:\/\/content.regdelta.com\/#document?uri=\/content\/karas\/c16834f9e233b36b81aa923ee4ed803b696d50c5.xml","Expected delivery date":"31.12.2021","Delivery Date":"31.12.2021","QA Metadata Analyst":"Samuel","Can you confirm that the metadata of the document is assigned correctly in RegDelta?":"yes","Formatting":"Pass|To Publish"},{"Project":"Library Request - Italy","Analyst Name":"Steve","Day tracked":44526,"Reg pub.
